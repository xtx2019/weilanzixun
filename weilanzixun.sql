The Japanese company proposed to divest its assets in France and Germany to satisfy European Commission’s concerns.\nHitachi Rail’s planned acquisition of Thales Ground Transportation Systems (GTS) business was announced in August 2021. Since that time, Hitachi Rail and Thales have been progressing towards completing the EUR 1.66 billion deal, securing the regulatory approvals necessary for the transaction to proceed, including achieving merger clearances in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions.\nIn November 2022, Hitachi Rail withdrew its EU filing after the Commission raised concerns over the potential impact of the merger on competition for mainline signalling projects in France and Germany.\n“We are delighted to be in a position to refile for clearance in the EU after working extensively with the Commission on a proposed divestment package which we are satisfied will address their concerns. We look forward to continuing to progress the acquisition of Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems (GTS), which we believe will deliver value for customers in the rail signalling and mobility sectors in Europe and globally,” a Hitachi Rail spokesperson said.\nHitachi Rail also expects to receive a decision on the proposed transaction from the UK anti – trust authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) shortly.\nOn September 18, Thales announced that together with Hitachi Rail have made significant progress towards the completion of the sale of Thales GTS business to Hitachi Rail. “The two groups have obtained most of the regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction. Over the last months, the parties have had constructive informal discussions with the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission about the proposed transaction,” Thales says.\nThe two companies expect that the transaction will have a positive impact on competition and will benefit rail signalling and mobility customers in Europe and globally. The two groups are continuing their discussions with the relevant authorities and are committed to finalising this transaction in the first half of calendar year 2024.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(2,'Railway PRO','Knorr-Bremse expands its technology centre in India','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/knorr-bremse-expands-its-technology-centre-in-india/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Knorr-Bremse-326x245.jpg','September 20, 2023','2023-09-20 16:34:14','The Knorr-Bremse Technology Centre India (TCI) located in Pune has been expanded for increased capacity to cover both rail and commercial vehicle sectors.\nThe company has recently inaugurated a new building complex at the cross-divisional TCI development centre, where some 1,300 experts will work on developing innovative transport technologies.

The rail infrastructure has been neglected for decades and pushed to its absolute limits. This is no longer acceptable and unworthy of a progressive economic nation. We need rail as it is the most climate-friendly mode of transport and it can only fulfill this task if it is again reliable, efficient and modern,” the minister said.\nThe Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) provides the funds required for investments in the rail infrastructure. In the draft budget for 2024 and the financial planning up to 2027, the BMDV’s individual plan earmarks an additional EUR 11.5 billion for railways. This is also made possible thanks to the income from the expanded truck toll. The climate and transformation fund will provide additional funds totalling EUR 12.5 billion also for railways, while Deutsche Bahn is also making its own contribution of EUR 3 billion. A further EUR 12.5 billion is to be made available through a further equity increase.\nThe minister explained that the “financial conditions have been created and the priorities have been set with high-performance corridors, the modernisation of train stations, digitalisation and the new construction and expansion of the infrastructure.”\n“We are renewing and modernizing the infrastructure with a programme that is unprecedented in DB history. A big thank you goes to the federal government for its commitment to provide the necessary additional funds amounting to up to EUR 45 billion. It is now up to us to roll up our sleeves together with the construction industry,” Richard Lutz, CEO of DB said.\nThe investment package for rail renewal plan and digitalisation projects will boost the development of railway transport.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe plan is focused on the renovation and expansion of heavily used network totalling 9,000 km, DB says. The BMDV and railway sector identified the heavily used routes* that will be renovated by 2030 so that they can deliver the greatest benefit and quickly lead to noticeable improvements. 40 rail routes totalling 4,000 km will be renovated by 2030, in addition to the renewal of other lines, the modernisation of stations and digitalisation of the railway transport. The stations along the routes will also be modernised and upgraded.\nThe overhaul of the Mannheim Riedbahn – Frankfurt am Main route will start in 2024, followed by Emmerich – Oberhausen and Hamburg – Berlin/Spandau corridors in 2025. The high-performance corridors Cologne – Hagen and Nuremberg – Regensburg corridors will be renovated starting 2026. Thereafter, ambitious progress will be made until the renovation of the last of the 40 rail corridors, the Mannheim – Karlsruhe corridor, for which works will begin in 2030. The DB will also significantly upgrade 20 stations along the Riedbahn alone as part of the renovation works.\nAnother component of the strategy is to clear the investment backlog and upgrading the rail network as well to create additional capacity through new measures which includes additional switches, a denser signalling system to provide traffic stability, predictability and ensure better and more punctual train service.\nGermany will continue the rail digitalisation programme rolling out the ETCS across the entire system delivering up to 30% more capacity on the existing network.\nTwo other goals are part of the new rail renewal plan and includes the targeted expansion and new construction of routes in order to resolve bottlenecks and thus make possible the Deutschlandtakt (Germany’s nationwide integrated regular interval timetable) as well as a large-scale modernisation and expansion programme for the train stations across the country.

It has taken into consideration the conclusions of the participatory process developed with representatives of the territory, neighborhood associations and merchants for a year and a half, which culminated with the presentation of the preliminary project in September 2022. Since then, three construction projects have been drawn up that will transform Barcelona Sants into a strategic node for the mobility of the future based on sustainability and multimodality as well as on an integrated approach into a city-model and citizen-oriented.\nThe projects define the Plaza Països Catalans, which recovers its original state, incorporating new green areas, children’s play areas and rest areas, responding to the concerns collected in the participatory process with neighbors and merchants.\nUnder the first phase of the project, the station’s passenger building will be renovated and modernised including the construction of a new boarding hall for high speed services, the expansion of areas dedicated for passengers using suburban services. Two new entrances to the station will be created on the sea-mountain axis and the lobby will be renovated and the other areas will be reorganised.\nThe surroundings of the station prioritise the spaces approaching the multimodal terminal, both pedestrian and road, after the traffic reorganisation initiated by the Barcelona City Council.\nThe Barcelona Sants project reconfigures the station as a central meeting point, surrounded by green spaces from east to west and from north to south, harmonising with the urban landscape, oriented as an opened element to the social, cultural and economic life of the city.\nThe transformation of the station and its surroundings is projected as a response to the increase the attractiveness of passenger rail transport, associated with the liberalisation process. It takes advantage of the opportunity to integrate the station into a new urban model, eliminating the roundabout effect and facilitating pedestrian connections.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe transformation of Barcelona Sants station is committed to sustainability by increasing the greenery and trees, incorporating photovoltaic panel installations in the new roofs for self-consumption with renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable construction, with the use of natural materials with a low carbon impact, such as granite, wood and metal.\nThe commitment to citizens and pedestrians is materialised by limiting road traffic to the street of Viriat, in addition to eliminating circulation in the northern area of Passeig de Sant Antoni, which is replaced by a public space.\nBarcelona Sants station will become a reference for a multimodal station including suburban and high-speed rail traffic, providing increased access to different types of transport including the active and last mile mobility made with bicycles and scooters.\nThe projects will be funded through the NextGenerationEU.\nBarcelona is currently modernising its public transport and heavy rail systems. In 2021, Adif awarded a contract for the second phase of the construction of a new rail access terminal at the Josep Airport Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat and in 2022 signed another contract for security and communications facilities which will be completed at the beginning of 2024. This new rail access will generate significant benefits to public transport mobility in Barcelona’s metropolitan area allowing direct services between two terminals of the airport and the stations in the city, including Sants station. When the project is completed, between 7 and 9 million passengers will use the new infrastructure each year. The first phase of this project has an estimated investment of EUR 305 million.\nOn public transport aspect, Transportes Metropolitanos de Barcelona has put into operation the first new metro train in March. Alstom was awarded a EUR 320 million contract for the supply of 50 Metropolis trains which will replace the existing metro fleet.\nIn addition, Alstom was awarded in 2022 a contract to install the APS power supply system for city’s tramway network and to retrofit 18 existing vehicles.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(8,'Railway PRO','Trams in Odessa modernised by engineers from the Republic of Moldova','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/three-trams-in-odessa-modernised/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tramvai-Odesa-326x245.png','September 18, 2023','2023-09-20 16:34:41','A team of engineers from the Republic of Moldova has recently completed the modernisation of three trams in Odessa with components they produced.\nThe trams underwent an aesthetic and technical upgrade programme, and the team of engineers from the Republic of Moldova contributed to the technical part.\nThe Moldovan engineers supplied the electric motor management components, replacing over a ton of old, inefficient equipment with their modern machines, which weigh less than 100 kg and improve consumption efficiency usually more than double if the previous systems are of the old type with huge reostate.

The results of these tests will then determine whether we decide to use hydrogen-powered trains on additional routes in Bavaria,” the Transport Minister of Bavaria, Christian Bernreiter, said.\nIn March 2021, Bayerische Regiobahn (BRB) awarded Siemens Mobility a contract for the supply of a hydrogen train prototype, as part of an agreement supported by the Bavaria’s Ministries of Transport and Economic Affairs to test and deploy hydrogen trains on the railway network.\nThe Mireo Plus H is a state-of-the-art hydrogen-powered train based on Siemens Mobility’s proven Mireo regional train platform.\nTwo roof-mounted fuel cells and a lithium-ion battery ensure completely CO2-free mobility. The H2 energy supply system, combined with the electric drive, provide high 1.7 MW traction power for acceleration of up to 1.1 m/s² and a top speed of 160 km/h. The train has an operating range between 1,000 and 1,200 km with one tank filling.\nThe Mireo Plus H also features the lowest lifecycle costs compared to other fuel cell trains on the market and can be quickly refueled in just 15 minutes. The Mireo is designed to be energy-saving and environmentally friendly with its monocoque, welded lightweight aluminum structure. In addition, its improved aerodynamics, energy-efficient components, and intelligent electrical system management effectively reduce the use of resources as well as emissions.\nBavaria aims at removing diesel train operation in local and regional transport by 2040 and according to the authorities’ plan, the goal will be achieved by electrifying the railway lines as well as deploying battery and hydrogen trains where electrification is not suitable of feasible.\n“With this first hydrogen train, Bavaria is taking another step towards a hydrogen future. By implementing the pilot project together with our partners Siemens and Bayerische Regiobahn, we are making the hydrogen future a tangible experience and at the same time gaining key practical know-how for the broad application of sustainable hydrogen innovations,” Bavaria’s Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger said.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(10,'Railway PRO','Adif extends questionnaire deadline for market opening','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/adif-extends-questionnaire-deadline-for-market-opening/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Adif-Spain-operators-326x245.jpg','September 15, 2023','2023-09-20 16:35:18','Adif and Adif AV are advancing the second phase of the rail passenger market liberalisation under which the existing and potential operators can response to an online consultation survey by September 29, 2023, a deadline extended by two weeks.\nThe consultation will help Spanish rail infrastructure manager to design the further opening of the market to competition.

Ultimately, the high-speed passenger MagRail trains are expected to run up to 550 km/h on railway lines, significantly reducing travel times.\nThe tests mark a “landmark moment in Nevomo’s development. For the first time in railway history, a rail vehicle moved not on the existing tracks, but over them, without friction. It shows that our MagRail technology is not just a vision for the future. It is a tangible solution for today. By leveraging existing infrastructure, we offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to modernizing rail transport, in line with the European Green Deal’s objectives,” Przemek Ben Paczek, CEO and Co-Founder of Nevomo said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nAfter 3.5 years of research and testing, Nevomo has thus demonstrated that it is possible to retrofit existing rail infrastructure with linear motor and magnetic levitation devices, hence combining the reliability of traditional rail systems with the potential of transformative technologies like Maglev and hyperloop.\n“The successful tests are the result of the knowledge and hard work of dozens of our engineers and experts. And this is just the beginning. We already collaborate with industry giants, including Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, SNCF, Duisport, and GATX to define various applications for MagRail, and these successful tests are paving the way for pre-commercial operational pilots,” Sebastian Kaluza, Product Development Director at Nevomo explains.\nInstead of running on fixed timetables, MagRail trains will be available to passengers in variable capacity, constantly adapting to current demand in stations, similarly to metro systems – but for inter-city trips. Using Nevomo’s technology, wagons would be able to move on their own and simply adjust the number of carriages per train “on the fly”. For that, upgrading selected sections or entire railway lines would be sufficient, eliminating the need to build entirely new transport infrastructure.\nNevomo will continue the research and the development of MagRail not only for levitation, but also for further exploration of different applications of the technology to improve efficiency and capacity for rail transport and finally to start commercialising the first version of MagRail for freight transport in 2024.\n \nThe construction of Europe’s longest passive magnetic levitation test track, on which Nevomo has conducted successful tests was co-financed by the European Union’s European Regional Development Fund under the Intelligent Development Programme. The project is being implemented as part of the “Fast Track” programme of the National Centre for Research and Development.\nTo date, for the development of the MagRail technology and its testing, Nevomo has raised EUR 11 million of funding, comprising EUR 5.5 million equity and EUR 5.5 million non-dilutive EU grants). Additionally, last year the company was awarded EUR 17.5 million from the European Commission (EIC Accelerator: EUR 2.5 million grant and EUR 15 million equity). Funds are also being raised for a Pre-Series A round of EUR 7 million. Nevomo’s key investors include EIT InnoEnergy and Hütter Private Equity.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(18,'Railway PRO','First ComfortJet carriages tested at Velim centre','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/first-comfortjet-carriages-cd-tested-at-velim/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CD-ComfortJet_VUZ_Velim-326x245.jpg','September 14, 2023','2023-09-20 16:35:59','The first six of 180 ComfortJet carriages for České dráhy have arrived at the VUZ Test Centre in Velim in Ostrava to enter testing and approval procedures. The Siemens Mobility – Škoda Group consortium which is supplying the new rolling stock must obtain approval for regular operation on the Czech and European railway lines. In the next weeks, the new vehicles “will undergo various examinations and tests necessary for the approval of the vehicles in the seven European countries in which their operation is planned,” Roman Kokšal, CEO of Siemens Mobility in the Czech Republic said.\nThe ComfortJet carriages will be put into operation between 2024 and 2026 on international routes from Prague to Hamburg, Graz and Budapest, among others.\n“The start of trials of the new ComfortJet carriages on the test railway circuit near Velim moves the project forward by another important step, without which it is impossible to put the brand new rolling stock into operation. It is now up to our suppliers and their partners to complete the tests in the planned schedule and quality and to get the units approved for regular operation in time,” Michal Krapinec, the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Czech Railways said.\n“We expect the first unit to be put into operation during the first quarter of next year. The exact date will depend on Siemens and Škoda, which must test and approve the trains at the railway authorities,” said Jiří Ješeta, the member of the Board of Directors of ČD and deputy general director of ČD for passenger transport division.\nThe units will enter trial operation on the connection between Prague and Ostrava and extended to Berlin, thus ensuring a comfortable journey from Prague to Berlin, Jiří Ješeta explained. This will follow the testing of restaurant and control cars which will be added to the new carriages and by 2026 the new rolling stock will enter full operation in push-pull mode, driven by Vectron locomotives from Siemens mobility. The trains will serve the routes to “Germany, but also to Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary, and we want to succeed with by deploying them also on trains to Denmark,” Jiří Ješeta mentioned.\nThe ComfortJet carriages are designed to be able to operate at a speed of 230 km/h including on the Berlin – Hamburg route, as well as on the other new lines, such as the Koralmbahn in Austria or the planned high-speed lines in the Czech Republic.\nIn April 2021, České dráhy and the consortium of Siemens Mobility and Škoda Group signed a EUR 500 million contract for the supply of 20 Viaggio Comfort nine-car non-traction units including control cars. The push-pull trains have a control car on one side and will be guided by a Vectron locomotive on the opposite side. This facilitates turn-arounds of the trainset at destination stations, as no change of locomotive is required.\nThe new vehicles are manufactured at the plants in Vienna, Munich and in Ostrava there are currently 10 railcars in various stages of development. Some of them are undergoing electrical systems and static tests and for other the final assembly will start soon, Tomáš Ignačák, the President of Škoda Group in the Czech Republic and Slovakia region explained.\nČeské dráhy is investing to renew its rolling stock to replace the existing old vehicles and to provide modern and comfortable journeys in order to increase passenger ridership and to increase the attractiveness of rail passenger services.\nAt the beginning of this year, the Czech national rail operator has launched a tender procedure to acquire 47 dual-voltage electric multiple units for regional services, a contract that will include the provision of spare parts and complete maintenance services for 15 years. EUR 354 million is the value of the contract.\nAnother step to renew its rolling stock was taken in November 2022 when České dráhy launched two tenders for up to 150 dual-voltage EMUs which will be used for long distance and suburban services. EUR 1.7 billion is the estimated value of both framework agreements. The first one includes the delivery of up to 90 90 EMUs for suburban traffic, while under the second contract the winner will supply up to 60 EMUs and their spare parts and ensure the maintenance services.\nČD’s plan to develop its fleet also includes a EUR 114.4 million framework contract signed with Pesa Bydgoszcz for 160 two-car DMUs with a firm order for 33 trainsets.\nIn addition, Škoda Group will provide maintenance services for the RegioPanter and InterPanter fleet until 2025 under a EUR 39 million contract.\n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(19,'Railway PRO','Moldova wants rail connections with Romania and EU','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/moldovan-prime-minister-asked-transport-minister-for-railway-connection-projects-with-romania-and-eu/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/spinu-recean-326x245.jpg','September 13, 2023','2023-09-20 16:36:04','Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean asked Transport Minister Andrei Spînu at the beginning of Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting to present the development vision for the field he oversees, “as did the ministers of Interior and Education”.

The new harmonised EU standards will enter into force on 28 September 2023.\nBy 28 March 2024, each Member State shall notify to the European Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways any national rules made redundant by the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2023/1693, together with a timetable for their withdrawal if not yet done.\n“By 28 June 2024, railway undertakings and infrastructure managers shall change their safety management system as defined in Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2016/798 in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation. Such changes, if limited to those strictly necessary to apply this Regulation, as amended, shall not be considered to be substantial changes to the safety regulatory framework within the meaning of Article 10(15) of Directive (EU) 2016/798,” the TSI package says.\nThe TSIs applied across the EU make the EU rail sector more efficient because they eliminate 25 different sets of national rules that still force trains to stop at borders, when driving from one EU country to another. Reducing complexity and parallel rules helps to improve affordability and lower the basic cost of rail operations.\nThe revised TSIs modernise and harmonise current technical standards for rail, and also align with TEN-T requirements and introduce a common framework for technical and operating conditions for ERTMS, the European Rail Traffic Management System, and combined transport, granting more flexibility for operators including in the intermodal transport.\nThe revised requirements also reflect recent technological developments, introducing rail innovation in a consistent manner. They pave the way for automatic train operations over ERTMS and digitalise technical and operating information for train drivers and rail staff, such as common infrastructure route and rule books for example, ensuring access to rail network knowledge.\nThe revised TSIs is a key milestone along the path to making smooth cross-border train journeys across the EU a reality, but also clears the way for new innovative technologies. Due to the revised standards the rail sector will respond better to the needs of long distance, cross-border services, and be able to a wider, more innovative range of rail services to citizens and transport clients.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(22,'Railway PRO','Grand Paris Express digital technology contract awarded','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/grand-paris-express-digital-technology-contract-awarded/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RATP-Paris-326x245.jpg','September 13, 2023','2023-09-20 16:36:22','Société du Grand Paris awarded Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and Nokia a contract to supply the IP network to power the Grand Paris Express.\nThe two companies are combining their offers to provide certified and integrated end-to-end mission-critical infrastructure for the Grand Paris Express with solutions that include a Nokia state-of-the-art multi-service IP/MPLS high-speed backbone network which includes the router portfolio to meet all the operation and maintenance requirements of the Grand Paris Express.

The new generation of Railjets, which will gradually be introduced on the route between Munich and Italy beginning April 2024, will also provide higher quality and more seats.\nAlso from December, ÖBB and DB will expand night train services offering Nightjet connections from Berlin and Vienna to Paris and Brussels. These connections will initially run three times a week, and beginning in the fall of 2024, the frequency will increase to daily traffic. This doubles the number of Nightjet connections available in Berlin.\nThe completely new ÖBB Nightjet trains will be in service for the first time from timetable change 2023/24. They will initially be used on the Hamburg – Vienna and Hamburg – Innsbruck connections. These newly developed Nightjets with speeds of up to 230 km/h offer a new level of comfort, including individual cabins (or mini cabins) in the couchette car and level boarding for people with restricted mobility. Further connections in Austria, Germany and Italy will follow in the course of 2024.\nThe two companies expect a 40% increase in passenger numbers compared to five years ago.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\n“More and more people in Germany and Austria are taking the climate-friendly train when they travel to neighboring countries. We want to boost growth even further with new trains, more comfort and convenience, and more connections. This can only be achieved through a joint effort by the rail companies involved. We’re responding to this growing demand by expanding the international timetable in close cooperation with ÖBB,” Stefanie Berk, Member of the DB Fernverkehr Management Board for Marketing said.\nÖBB announced that 33 next-generation Nightjet trains will be operating in Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands by 2025.\nIn September 2022, ÖBB and Siemens Mobility unveiled the latest generation of Nightjet couchette and sleeping car tailored to the needs of today’s passengers and offer modern design, enhanced comfort and more privacy. The first of these new trains will operate on popular routes to Italy from both Austria and Germany.\nThe new generation of Nightjet trains consists of seven carriages, which include two seat cars, three couchettes and two sleeping cars. The total maximum capacity for each one is 254 seats.\nSiemens Mobility is also supplying Deutsche Bahn the ICE 4 train fleet. In 2022, the two companies celebrated the delivery of the 100th ICE 4 train and a total fleet of 137 such type train will be delivered by the end of 2024. In 2011, the two companies signed a framework agreement for the supply if up to 300 trainsets with a firm order for 130 ICE 4 trains which have been regular operation since late 2017. These new trains will replace the ICE 1 and ICE 2 fleets. It is expected that ICE 4 trains will be responsible for roughly 70 percent of Deutsche Bahn’s long distance transport revenue.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(27,'Railway PRO','New trams enter service in Turin','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/new-trams-enter-service-in-turin/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hitachi-Rail-turin-tram-326x245.jpg','September 12, 2023','2023-09-20 16:36:44','Gruppo Torinese Trasporti (GTT) has put into service the new Turin bespoke trams manufactured by Hitachi Rail at the factory in Naples.\nAn initial 30 trams are to enter passenger operation as part of a framework agreement signed in May 2020 for the supply of 70 new light rail vehicles by 2024. The contract is funded by the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility through an agreement with the City of Turin aimed at boosting rail transport in large urban centres.\nEach light rail vehicle has a maximum speed of 60 km/h, is 28 meters long, and is able to accommodate up to 218 passengers. The trams livery takes up the yellow and blue colours that represent the city of Turin, and the colour scheme of the new GTT buses.\nThe service will deliver a high level of passenger comfort and design, providing exceptional space compared to previous models and an innovative air conditioning system that ensures a continuous exchange of air from the outside, guaranteeing high safety standards.\nThe Turin bespoke trams, based on Siro tram platform, are designed to combine large windows with transparent sides to the roof, providing excellent internal brightness and visibility of the outside world.\n“Hitachi Rail’s new trams for the city of Turin represents the evolution of the previous Siro model, of which hundreds have been built for cities in Italy and abroad. The trams incorporate new technologies and high quality standards for reliability and passenger comfort, and are designed to further encourage the use of public transport in cities,” Luca D’Aquila, COO of Hitachi Rail, said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe new vehicles are equipped with two areas for people with disabilities and provide easy access and good manoeuvrability for wheelchairs.

The size of the German high-performance network will almost triple to over 9,200 km by 2030. By means of prevention using HSG technology, for instance, we will further increase the reliability of our network,” Heike Junge-Latz, Member of the Board of Management responsible for Plant and Maintenance Management at DB Netz said.\nThe globally unique grinding process for preventive rail maintenance allows an operating speed of more than 80 km/h on mainline tracks. This allows Vossloh machines to “float along” with freight traffic at night, for example, making line closures obsolete. The grinding program can be individually adapted to the respective track condition. Under the current contract, for example, additional cross-sectional optimisation has been carried out on some sections of track.\nIn addition to the actual grinding work, DB Netz has also ordered the use of extensive digital measurement and analysis technology. During the crossing, important condition data is collected and evaluated in real time, and relevant information can be visualized in a web-based application, including concrete recommendations for action. This creates the basis for a transition from time-based to condition-based maintenance.\n“The importance of preventive and condition-based maintenance measures cannot be overstated.

The two officials launched the new line during a videoconference and the ceremony was also attended at by the Russian Railways CEO Oleg Belozerov and the Governor of the Moscow Region Andrei Vorobyov.\n“Today, another serious step has been taken in the development of the Moscow Transport Hub. Everything that has been done today is for the benefit of Moscow, the Moscow Region and all the people who live in this region and come here. We are talking about millions of people without any exaggeration; millions who will now have better logistics and a better quality of life. This is a serious step forward for the economy,” Vladimir Putin said at the ceremony.\nThe 86 km MCD-4 is the longest line of the diameter network running across the city from West to East and connects seven central railway terminals of the Russian capital. The Kaluzhsko – Nizhegorodskaya line provides for the largest number of transfer stations – 18 with 36 options of interchanges to the metro, MCC and other diameters. Works are being carried out to open two more stations (Begovaya and Rizhskaya stations) in the future.\nAccording to Moscow Metro, the new line will be used by 270,000 passengers per day with forecasts to meet increased demand as the infrastructure is designed to accommodate future growth in passenger traffic.\n“We will continue to develop the diameter after the launch of MCD-4. We will build two Moscow city stations Begovaya and Rizhskaya, and we will acquire renew the rolling stock,” Maksim Liksutov, the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for Transport said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe MCD-4 is operated by EP2D and EP2DM trains which run at intervals of up to 5 – 5.5 minutes during peak hours and without interruptions during the daytime. In the future, the line will be operated by the new Ivolga 4.0 trains, the modern Russian commuter trains. The fleet of MCD-4 trains is planned to be completely renewed by 2025.\nIt is expected that the nearby lines of the Moscow Metro will be relieved by 9% due to the redistribution of passenger flows, while the daily passenger flow of the fourth diameter may reach 455,000 passengers.\nIn August 2023, Moscow inaugurated the 85 km long MCD-3 connecting the city on north-west and south-east axis.\nThe fourth Moscow Central Diameter is part of Moscow Transport Hub programme which covers the modernisation and development of transport system in the city and its region. The authorities are working on the MCD-5 line project which will provide the connection between the north-east part of the city at Pushkino station and south suburbs at Domodedovo station.

Whether we are talking about the mid-19th century American Wild West or the frozen steppes of Russia, it is undeniable that the existence of a railway in a region was synonymous with the arrival of progress. That’s what Kenya believed six years ago when it decided to sign a project with a Chinese state giant to build a railway line across the country. The project has not proved effective and the African country’s budget has been saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars. The project has become the subject of an investigation into the strategy of Chinese investors abroad.\n \nKenya’s Standard Gauge Railway, a project known as the Standard Gauge Railway, was touted at its launch as a major economic driver that will benefit the region. A railway would run east-west across the country from the Indian Ocean (Mombasa) to the western border with Uganda. Six years after its inauguration, the railway has become a financial burden for the country and a key cause of its deteriorating relationship with China. The line has become stuck a little further from the country’s capital Nairobi to the town of Naivasha, some 300 kilometres from the western border.\nThe work was started by the China Road and Bridge Corporation under former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta under a no-bid contract and a USD 3.6bn loan from China’s Exim Bank.\n \nAn optimistic feasibility study\nThe feasibility study carried out claimed that the rail project would become profitable by transporting 22 million tonnes of freight per year, i.e. 20 trains per day. This is more than double the current operating capacity\nof the line, according to a study by the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis.\nThe line in question ended up operating only 25% of the quantity, below the break-even point. In 2021, the railroad lost USD 200 million. The measures initially adopted, namely a ban on trucking, have aroused the displeasure of truckers and have not proved effective.\nShortly after being elected in 2022, President William Ruto reversed Kenyatta’s order, but the debts to the Chinese remained. After several years of deferred payments, Kenya’s first payment to China in 2021 was over USD 237 million. In 2022, this more than doubled to USD 558 million.\nChinese loans now account for 67% of Kenya’s debt, which has reached an all-time high of USD 82 billion, or about three-quarters of the country’s gross domestic product. As Kenya’s debt payments rise, they leave less money for other purposes, such as healthcare and security.\nShortly after taking office, President Kenyey, following a decision by the Kenyan judiciary, denounced three quarters of the loan agreement on the grounds that it had been committed non-transparently, outside a competitive procedure.\n\n \nChina refuses loan extension, Uganda picks its own builders\nA Kenyan request for a 30-year loan extension has been rejected. What’s more, last summer China fined Kenya nearly USD 11m, saying it had defaulted on its railway payments.\nUnder pressure from increasingly problematic lending around the world, China has begun to pull back on financing. In Kenya, China said it would not borrow more money to extend the railway to Uganda and beyond. Moreover, in January Uganda announced it was dropping its contract with the Chinese builder in favour of one from Turkey to build the line to the Kenyan border.\n \nHow autonomous were Chinese companies\nAll these developments, as I said, have become the subject of recent academic research which has set out to answer some questions. Are Chinese state-owned companies instruments of China’s central political power or are they somewhat autonomous entities? Do they arrive in investment destination countries with well- drawn agendas from home or not? The answers were somewhat surprising, far from what many might think. The study on the evolution of the Kenyan project was based on interviews with managers and employees in the construction and operational departments of the China Road and Bridge Corporation, opinion formers in Kenya and representatives of the Kenya Railways Corporation. Local government workers, private sector representatives, lawyers and researchers were consulted.\nThe study found that decisions by Chinese state-owned enterprises in Kenya do not necessarily exhibit a grand centralized strategy at the level of the Chinese state, but a combination, often formed ad hoc between changing political and economic circumstances in China, state interests and private interests of Chinese companies.\nIn Kenya, the China Road and Bridge Corporation has constantly changed its strategies. It has also adapted to local circumstances in the country and across East Africa, rather than just imposing its strategic priorities. This has compromised its own economic productivity interests and its public image.\nThus one of the strategies chosen was land purchases, often made prior to the start of the project in order to solve problems related to delayed land compensation.\nThis involved direct payments, negotiated on a case-by- case basis, to landowners. As a result, landowners released land for project construction before land settlements were formally approved by the Kenyan state. One of the reasons for this rather unconventional approach was to reduce costs.\nThe Chinese company had learned from the early stage of the project that late delivery of even a small plot of land could increase the cost of the project if labour and equipment were idle.\nThen, the operation of the line was entrusted to a Chinese company (SGR) as operating the railway would not be financially beneficial for the company. But the stakes were too high to leave it to chance. The operational challenges that a new company could have faced could have damaged the public image of the project as well as the Chinese corporation itself. The company therefore had to balance short-term financial interests with long-term reputational concerns.\nAll this shows that Beijing’s infrastructure development strategies are not pre-determined, but change and can even be reversed due to changing circumstances in overseas regions. These strategies aimed at saving the Chinese company’s face are important for winning other contracts. Despite the dispute, China Road and Bridge Corporation has been awarded other key national projects, such as the Nairobi Expressway, where work started in autumn 2020. “This highlights that African countries are not passive recipients of Chinese-funded projects. They have an important role to play in counterbalancing Chinese actors to shape the way these projects are carried out on the ground,” the study recommends.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(36,'Railway PRO','The way Austria works for its future','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/the-way-austria-works-for-its-future/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/koettmannsdorf-lambichl-oebb-evmedia-2-326x245.jpg','September 7, 2023','2023-09-20 16:37:28','Austria is preparing its rail infrastructure to decarbonise the transport system and achieve climate neutrality a decade earlier than the EU. A sustainable transport system means transforming all modes of transport, and rail is at the heart of it, thanks to its well-known characteristics. The mobility strategy published by the Austrian government positions the transport system as an evolution of society and economic development, the key being the shift of traffic to sustainable modes. In the meantime, Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) is doing its utmost to develop and electrify the network, with investments of EUR 19 billion included for the period 2023-2028.\n \nIn 2021, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK) published the Mobility Master Plan 2030 which aims to significantly develop the economy and combat the effects of climate change with ambitions that go beyond the EU targets.\nIn the authorities’ plan, Austria would achieve climate neutrality in 2040 and use all renewable energy in 2030. Austria accounts for 2.2% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions, and its average carbon intensity is lower than the EU average and declining. In 2019, the transport sector was responsible for 30% of the country’s total emissions, while energy industries accounted for 13% of Austria’s total emissions. In the same year, the share of renewable energy resources was 33.6%.\nIf in 2019 Austria’s population was 8.9 million, by the beginning of 2022 it has increased by 127,000 people to 9.1 million, and by 2050 Eurostat shows that the population will increase to 9.34 million, which obviously means higher consumption, increasing mobility, and increasing carbon intensity, unless specific measures are introduced.\nThe transport system is the largest emitter of emissions and is responsible for 30% of total national emissions, with only 1% of emissions reduced between 2005 and 2019. The main reasons why transport emissions are so high are due to the increase in distances travelled and the fuel in transit traffic. An International Energy Agency (IEA) report for 2020 states that fuel tourism emissions account for 6.5% of Austria’s total energy-related emissions. This is due to the fact that in transit traffic, diesel prices are lower than in neighbouring countries, which leads drivers to refuel in Austria and consume the fuel in another country, which is exported in tankers. As a result, one of the government’s measures would include increasing transit charges for heavy-duty vehicles and promoting the shift of road traffic to rail.\nTraffic shift and energy transition – by moving away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy resources – are key to creating a sustainable transport system that contributes to achieving the goals, and these two factors play a crucial role in transport system transition.\n\n \nIn the 2030 Mobility Master Plan, rail transport has a prominent place due to its ability to reduce emissions and transport large volumes of freight and passengers using electricity from renewable resources. And this is not only true for reducing road traffic, but also for air traffic, which can be taken over by transport services on high-speed and night train connections (an important project for the national company ÖBB). As a result, the plan is to shift air traffic to rail transport, which would reduce emissions.\nThe authorities’ plan is that, through the measures and projects implemented, private road transport will decrease by 19%, from 61% in 2018 to 42% in 2040.\nThe target for sustainable transport in the passenger segment can be achieved by expanding accessible public transport networks, promoting active transport and walking, and introducing innovative solutions and state- of-the-art technologies that will lead the public to choose these modes over road transport – which in turn will be decarbonised by the introduction of electric vehicles.\nIn the case of rail freight, the strategy states that although the market share of this mode of transport is essential because the greater the volume, the more freight can be transported using the same amount of energy, it is nevertheless difficult to shift from road to rail or waterway over moderate distances, or in some market segments. In addition, about 80% of the transport volume in Austria is cross-border traffic which would limit the ability of rail to become more attractive, and “isolated” measures would allow a minor increase in rail’s share of the modal split.\nUnder these circumstances, a 40% share (initially set by the transport strategy for 2012) could only become a reality if measures are taken at European level by implementing measures to optimise the efficiency of international rail traffic and by introducing cost transparency for each mode of transport which will increase the efficiency of the logistics chain and focus on regionalisation. Increasing the share of rail freight to 40% representing 35 trillion tonne-kilometres could be achieved in cooperation with Europe, with Austria alone able to achieve an increase to 34%.\nIn 2022, Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) carried 210.7 million passengers, up 29% on the 2021 level, and long- distance transport saw a meteoric rise of 71% to 41.8 million passengers. There are two main reasons for this growth, one being tourism, which made a “significant contribution to the good passenger figures”, and another being the introduction of climate ticket in October 2021, “by the end of 2022, over 200,000 had been sold, far exceeding original expectations. In 2023 we expect the rail boom to continue,” said the CEO of ÖBB Andreas Matthä in April 2023 when presented company’s financial statement for 2022. According to him, the railways are expected to continue to boom this year.\nAs for rail freight, which has faced overlapping crises (the war in Ukraine, rising energy prices, falling production, but also material bottlenecks involving the entire logistics chain), ÖBB Rail Cargo Group (RCG) transported 88.4 million net tonne-kilometres in 2022, covering over 27 billion net tonne-kilometres. The operator transported 1.2 million tonnes of grain from Ukraine with more than 100 trains per month, “more than any other freight transport company in Europe”. Last year, RCG services ran 448,000 trains, with a daily average of 1,230 trains.\nAs with the EU strategy, Austria also points out that rail freight and inland waterway transport have the great advantage of energy efficiency, even as road transport becomes decarbonised. In this context, the strategy states that rail freight must play a key role in supporting overall transport growth and that attractive and easily planned services must be developed, including for international traffic.\n\n\n \nInfrastructure investment\nIn any case, there can be no efficient services to ensure high flows of goods or passengers if the infrastructure does not allow it, in which case it must be adequate and extensive, with the national authorities’ plans for road and rail infrastructure, which are coordinated with each other, enabling the most efficient and possible options to be adopted in order to create a sustainable multimodal system, based in particular on electrification.\nAlmost every year, ÖBB invests more than EUR 3 billion in railway infrastructure, and last year the company invested EUR 3.9 billion, with the bulk of this being distributed to projects for the renovation and extension of infrastructure (including the southern and western lines), electrification of regional lines and modernisation and construction of stations, including the creation of park and ride facilities. In addition, as renewable energy is key to decarbonising the railway ÖBB is also focusing on power stations, wind power plants and photovoltaic for which last year it built 23 new photovoltaic plants and connected the world’s first wind power plant for traction power to the grid in Höflein (Lower Austria). It is worth noting that in Austria, Rail Cargo Group operates entirely on green traction current, and the electricity for and stations comes entirely from renewable resources. ÖBB-Infrastruktur is one of Europe’s greenest infrastructure managers as it runs 90% on hydropower as part of the rail power supply mix. Austria’s railway system will become climate neutral by 2040, but the federal government plans to reach this goal in 2035.\nAccording to the company, in 2022 the railway infrastructure carried 260 million passengers and 100 million tonnes of freight, with 69 railway undertakings covering a total of 164 million train kilometres. The railway infrastructure is 5,000 km long and is one of the densest network with high performance, forming the core of the country’s public transport. According to the Eleventh Annual Market Monitoring Report of IRG-Rail, published in 2023, 72% (i.e. over 4,000 km) of the Austrian network is electrified and 510 km (9%) is equipped with ERTMS/ETCS. The intensity of use of the network is predominantly passenger traffic with 60% (in train-km per route-km per day) and 25% freight traffic.\n\n \nAccording to the Mobility Strategy 2030, in order for the rail system to be fully decarbonised, measures are being addressed both in terms of infrastructure and rolling stock that will run on alternative propulsion technologies. In terms of infrastructure, 500 km of lines are expected to be electrified by 2030 when the network will be 85% electric, with the priority routes being those that are feasible for this work and most cost-effective. The routes of greatest importance are those on the TEN-T, those with dense connections for passenger traffic, those essential for freight and lines that are important for diversion. In addition to these lines, other routes could be included in the project, but only after considering the introduction of existing rolling stock operating technologies – hydrogen or battery electric – for which pilot projects have been initiated.\nEven with this performance, the Austrian railway needs development, expansion and electrification to cope with future traffic as an increasing flow of freight and passengers has to be absorbed from road transport and, in addition, a growing population will mean a greater demand for transport, resulting in quite intense and high volume traffic.\nIn 2021, ÖBB announced that by 2026 it will invest EUR 25 billion, of which EUR 20.6 billion will be allocated to infrastructure expansion and renewable energy projects and EUR 3.4 billion to passenger rolling stock.\nIn October 2022, the Council of Ministers announced that ÖBB’s master plan for 2023-2028 involves investments of EUR 19 billion over the next five years, up from the plan for 2022-2027 (which had a value of over EUR 18 billion). The investments include two major priority projects involving the Brenner Base Tunnel with an allocation of EUR 2.1 billion, i.e. 11% of the value of the investment plan, and the creation of the new connection in the south involving the Koralmbahn and Semmering Base Tunnel with a total allocation of EUR 2.8 billion, representing 15% of the investment plan for the next five years. Apart from these projects, the largest amount of EUR 5.1 billion will be distributed to station conversion, terminal and new line construction projects including extension of existing lines, followed by reinvestment in Park&Ride and noise protection facilities with an allocation of EUR 4.4 billion and EUR 4 billion for maintenance works. EUR 2.5 billion will also be allocated for electrification and making routes more attractive, and EUR 2.1 billion for security and operational management systems.\n\nBy region\nBroken down by region, the plan shows that the largest amount of investment, EUR 7.4 billion, will go to projects in the Eastern Region, where Vienna is an arterial hub of the network and capacity is expected to increase. Here expansion projects, line and station works, electrification and planning of new projects (most including double- tracking, electrification) will be implemented.\nIn terms of investment value allocated by region, second place is Tyrol with EUR 4 billion where Innsbruck is in the core area of the railway system, followed by Styria with EUR 2.8 billion where Graz is the railway hub, third place is Upper Austria with EUR 2.4 billion where the Linz railway hub is important, and in Carinthia for projects impacting the Klagenfurt hub, EUR 1.1 billion will be allocated. Also in Salzburg, projects will be allocated EUR 735 million and in Vorarlberg EUR 483 million. For the rail hub cities of the above regions, plans include the extension of local transport from their metropolitan areas. For Rheintal-Walgau, the central areas of Tyrol and Carinthia, as well as for Salzburg, further station works, electrification and the creation of public transport links are identified which will increase the attractiveness of services.\nIn the central part of Upper Austria, work involves quadrupling the Linz – Wels route, with work continuing on the Marchtrenk – Wels section to create the necessary capacity. The project will have an allocation of EUR 1.3 billion by 2030.\nOther projects in the region involve the extension of the Pyhrn Line (an important north-south axis) by doubling the lines on certain sections which will allow trains to run between Linz and Selzthal at speeds of over 160 km/h, covering the route in one hour and 15 minutes, 15 minutes less than today.\nIncreasing the attractiveness of the S-Bahn routes, in particular the Summerauerbahn (Summerau Railway), is another measure that promotes rail transport by offering quality services. The Summerau Railway is a 61 km line between Linz and Summerau and is an important commuter and tourist route.\nThe Eastern Region metropolitan area includes Vienna, St. Pölten and Eisenstadt and quadruple track works are included. This includes, for example, the Meidling – Mödling line, which by 2034 will have a budget of EUR\n1.26 billion, the Pottendorfer Line which foresees the quadrupling of the 50 km section between Wien Meidling and Wiener Neustadt with a budget for 2023 of EUR 635 million, the connection between Vienna airport and Bruck an der Leitha (with a budget of EUR 1.68 billion by 2032) and the modernisation of the Meidling – Hütteldorf line, for which EUR 345 million will be allocated by 2028, seen as a project that will improve the quality of the Austrian capital’s railway system.\nIn the metropolitan region of Graz, the projects are significant. One of these involves the extension of the Southern Line and comprises several projects involving the modernisation of 200 km, the construction of 170 km, with 80 km of tunnels and 150 new bridges. By 2030, the line will allow direct and fast journeys between Vienna and Klagenfurt (2 h 40 min) and from Graz to Klagenfurt (in just 45 min). The line will be 470 km long, crossing the Semmering and Koralpe mountains, and includes the two key projects Semmering Base Tunnel and Koralm Railway. The electrification of the Styrian Eastern Railway between Graz and Mogersdorf on the Hungarian border, which should be completed by 2028 and level crossings eliminated.\nThe 2023-2028 investment plan foresees EUR 1.8 billion for the modernisation of the regional vehicle fleet and the implementation of electrification projects in rural areas to increase the attractiveness of transport services.\n\nEssential tunnels\nThe Koralmbahn is part of the Southern Line and when it becomes operational, it will strengthen connectivity on the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor. The line, which crosses the Koralpe mountain, will provide a direct link between Graz and Klagenfurt, connecting Styria and Carinthia quickly and efficiently. The project involves the construction of 130 km of line, of which 47 km in tunnels (of which 33 km form the Koralm Tunnel) and 100 bridges. The project includes 23 stations and stops of which 12 will be new. Construction started in 1999 in Styria and in 2001 in Carinthia, and June 2023 was a real success for the project, when the first train passed through the Koralm Tunnel for the first time after 15 years of work. On board the official train were the two governors of the regions of Carinthia and Styria, transport councillors of the two regions as well as Member of the Board for ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG Judith Engel and ÖBB project manager Klaus Schneider.\nTo build the 33 km tunnel with an internal diameter of 10 metres, cross-passages were constructed every 500 metres, 6 million m³ of material were excavated and 13,000 track slabs and 160,000 of concrete tunnel were installed.\nAccording to the project, the section between Klagenfurt and St. Paul im Lavanttal will be put into operation this year, and the whole line is expected to become operational in 2025, when trains will run at 250 km/h, making a 45-minute journey between the cities of Graz and Klagenfurt.\n“The Koralm Tunnel is an internationally renowned piece of engineering and the heart of one of the most important traffic axes of the future – not only for Styria, but for all of Austria. It closes a very important gap in the European infrastructure,” the Governor of Styria, Christopher Drexler said.\nAs of 20 July, ÖBB announced that the Klagenfurt – St. Paul im Lavanttal section in Carinthia is close to being opened at the end of this year and tests on the bridges have started, the longest in Carinthia being the new Drau Bridge in the Völkermarkt area with a length of 600 metres.\nThe tests are carried out with 6 ÖBB locomotives, each weighing 80 tonnes, which are at the same time crossing the bridges, resulting in the evaluation of the test information so that the section of line can be used safely. Apart from this bridge, tests continue on the Klopeiner Seebachbrücke, a new underpass and the Peratschitzen railway bridge. In October one of Austria’s highest railway bridges – the Jauntalbrücke – is expected to be completed. By 2025, ÖBB Rahmenplan says the project will benefit from investments of more than EUR 6 billion, including the realisation of the rail connection to Klagenfurt Airport.\nThe Semmering Base Tunnel is another important Southern Line project that will provide direct connectivity between Lower Austria and Styria, offering a journey time of less than two hours between Graz and Vienna.\nThe tunnel will be open to traffic from 2030 when it will connect the towns of Gloggnitz (Lower Austria) and Mürzzuschlag (Styria), thus reducing traffic on the current Semmering Line, which is used by about 180 trains daily and is one of Austria’s most congested routes. The tunnel is part of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor and will also be used by freight trains, making it more attractive and resulting in higher capacity and shorter journey times.\nThe tunnel will be 27 km long and will be created through a 62 km tunnel system, with excavation completed in summer 2022 for 90% of the tunnel which is being built from five locations. More than 24 kilometres of the 27.3 kilometres of the twin-tube tunnel have already been dug. Total project costs have increased by EUR 390 million to EUR 3.9 billion and more than EUR 4 billion will be allocated to the project by 2030.\nEssential for cross-border traffic between Austria and Italy and located on the Scandinavia-Mediterranean core network corridor is the Brenner Base Tunnel which will connect Innsbruck to Franzensfeste. The tunnel system between Innsbruck and Fortezza is 55 km long. The project is implemented by the company Brenner Basistunnel BBT SE and will be 64 km long between Fortezza and Tulfes/ Innsbruck, ending in Innsbruck, via the existing bypass tunnel with its end point in Tulfes.\n \n\nIn June 2023, on Austrian territory, the second mega drilling machine started its 8.4 km journey that will dig from the western part of the tunnel to the south, while in May the other TBM started excavation on the eastern section of the tunnel (Sill Gorge-Pfons section), towards Brenner Pass over a length of 8 km. It is worth mentioning that in March TBM Virginia completed excavation of 14 km (in four years) of the eastern part of the main tunnel, reaching Brenner Pass, completing work on section H61 Mules 2-3, the largest construction lot of the tunnel project. Earlier this year, BBT SE analysed the cost of the project which came to EUR 10.5 billion of which EUR 8.54 billion are construction costs, EUR 1 billion is the estimation for risk provision, and EUR 903 million is the estimation made on currency adjustment, representing the likely inflation applicable to future costs.\nEuropean funding is essential for the implementation of the Brenner Base Tunnel, for which Italy and Austria were initially supposed to receive 50% co-financing for planning and exploration and 40% for construction works. In February 2023, the EU pledged EUR 1.6 billion in co- financing, and in June 2023, through the Connecting Europe Facility 2021-2027, BBT SE obtained co-financing of EUR 700 million. It should be recalled here that through the same call for proposals, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) received EUR 2 million for the preliminary design of the Rovereto Bypass, part of the Southern Access Route project located on the Fortezza – Verona section. This European co-financing provides funding for 50% of the works costs, up from 40% (initially agreed) to 10%. The remaining costs are shared equally between Italy and Austria. Under the ÖBB plan (2023-2028), the Brenner Base Tunnel project will be allocated EUR 4.97 billion by 2032.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(37,'Railway PRO','Work begins on Iraq-Iran rail link','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/work-begins-on-iraq-iran-rail-link/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iran-irak-e1693994337757-326x245.jpg','September 6, 2023','2023-09-20 16:37:32','Iraq’s prime minister inaugurated construction work on the Iraq-Iran rail link.

The WaggonTrack- er Load Monitoring System determines and displays relevant data in real time, in particular weight, overload, asymmetric loading and free capacity. Optionally, the loads on wheel discs, wheelsets and bogies can also be de- termined. The real-time results are displayed in the web portal or – depending on customer specifications – the results are visualised directly on the wagon by means of signal lamps.\nIn the DB Cargo application, the automated system fulfils several parameters:\n\nControl of the weighing data provided by customers\nAvoiding of overloading\nAvoiding time-consuming weighing carried out manually\nBest possible utilisation and optimal utilisa- tion of transports\nIncreased safety, as overloading of individu- al components is excluded\n\n \n“Automatic load weight monitoring does opti- mise operations. By using sensors in future, the automated process will reduce the time required by determining the load weight, including its distribution,” says Michael Wolkow, Head of Procurement, Equipment and Technology at DB Cargo AG.\n \n“In general, the automated load monitoring system is a great support for the shipper on site. Overloading or asymmetrical loading are indicated by signal lamps directly on the wagon and the person responsible for loading can take corrective action during the loading process. The wagon owner subsequently benefits from cost savings, as damage to the wagon that can occur due to incorrect loading is excluded,” says Günter Petschnig, CEO of PJM.\n \nThe load monitoring system is already in use at international customers, e.g. Europe’s larg- est timber logistics company Mercer, Lenzing AG and Mercitalia. A novelty in this project is that DB Cargo is doing the upgrading itself: System integration and wagon installation are carried out independently in the workshops of the leading German rail logistics company.\nThe basis for automatic weight monitoring is the WaggonTracker digital overall system The digital backbone for the application of automated weight monitoring is the Waggon- Tracker system. The patented and award-win- ning WaggonTracker is the only system in the world that records comprehensive information about freight wagons in real time and at the same time automates time-consuming pro- cesses such as brake testing or load weight control. These numerous functionalities are made possible thanks to an autonomous and powerful power supply produced by a wheel hub generator. The WaggonTracker system is freely scalable, open for further customer-spe- cific applications and DAC-compatible.\n \nWood and bulk goods are “difficult” trans- port goods\nLoading wood and bulk goods is still challeng- ing for transporters today in terms of efficient capacity utilisation. Every bulk good can ab- sorb a certain amount of liquid and wood can have weight differences of up to 50 % due to the different density and moisture content of the wood. Volume is therefore not the decisive factor, because the risk of either overloading the wagon or underloading it is too great. In both cases, this is at the expense of efficiency and economy. Overloading shortens the life of the wagon, is a safety issue and leads to removing the waggons at infrastructure points.\nThanks to the automatic load weight control, the load weight as well as its distribution (bogie load) is recorded in real time. This ensures the best possible loading capacity of all wagons.\n\nPJM at a glance\nPJM is an internationally renowned system specialist for rail transport and has successfully implemented projects in 30 countries on 6 continents.

The latest trends in railway coatings contribute to the environmentally friendly character of train travel.\nRail travel has come a long way since the first train ran from Stockton to Darlington in September 1825. Railways have spread around the world and trains have become ever more comfortable, faster, and more technologically and optically advanced. The same is true for the coatings which protect them inside and out. Today, you can catch a train to countless destinations whether you make a journey across the continent, commute to work, or take a tram to your favourite café in town. According to Eurostat, 8.2 billion rail passengers were recorded in the EU in 2019, and 399 billion tonne-km of freight were transported by rail in the EU.\nA means of design and functionality and safety\nRailways are the safest and most ecological mode of public transport for passengers and for cargo. People generally assume that a perfectly coated train is safer than a train with faded or peeling paint or one covered in graffiti. And this assumption is not far-fetched: Coatings are not only a means to apply a smart design, they make a significant contribution to the functionality, durability and value retention of rail vehicles.\nRail vehicles and their coatings have to withstand a lot of stress. They are in constant use. They are exposed to all kinds of weather from extreme summer heat and UV radiation to harsh winter weather. And they have to be resistant against aggressive detergents including graffiti removal which is particularly hard on the coating. In the long run, corrosion leads to lasting damage, which can result in the failure of important train components.\nFurthermore, specific railway coating solutions like the assortment from KANSAI HELIOS group fulfil highest requirements for the fire behavior of materials and components of rail vehicles according to the standard DIN EN45545. Fire-resistant materials and products in railway vehicles significantly reduce the likelihood of fires and effectively contain the spread of smoke and flames. This crucial measure extends the evacuation time for passengers and staff, ultimately leading to the preservation of lives. In addition, coated surfaces are the basis for safety-critical bonding processes of items such as windows and entire heads of passenger railcars take place.\nOn track towards more sustainability and cost reduction\nModern railway coatings are equipped with many features to protect rail vehicles from such stress: anti-graffiti properties, high colour retention, stone-chip resistance, resistance against detergents and chemicals, and of course, high corrosion protection in all weather conditions.\nKANSAI HELIOS invests much time and effort in R&D to develop products for all requirements. The focus is on environmental compatibility and the reduction of energy consumption. The outstanding quality and durability of our coatings is certified by the numerous approvals of many major railway operators across Europe and beyond.\nUltra high solids reduce strain on the environment\nKANSAI HELIOS ultra high solids (UHS) coatings are a perfect example to show that ecology and economy can go hand in hand – without compromising the protective performance. Polyaspartic UHS products, for example, have a solid content of up to 90% and very low VOC emissions. Another essential advantage of UHS are the short drying times at low temperatures which accelerate the coating process significantly. The latest UHS products dry within 60 minutes at room temperature while waterborne coatings – also an environmentally friendly and durable product – require temperatures of about 50°C for 3 to 4 hours. This means that UHS coatings reduce energy consumption considerably and result in lower CO2 emissions and lower costs.\nAnti-graffiti coatings: innovative and tough\nGraffiti can be art, but on trains it hardly ever is. Graffiti has to be removed, and this is a costly problem for all rail operators from city trams to high-speed intercity trains. The Berlin S-Bahn (suburban train), for example, spends around EUR 1.2 million a year on graffiti removal. If a train with eight coaches is covered with graffiti on both sides, it takes five people and 80 working hours to remove it. Often, the original paint of the vehicle is affected by the process and needs to be repaired.\nKANSAI HELIOS has developed an anti-graffiti coating system consisting of primer, waterborne base coat, and an innovative and extremely tough anti-graffiti clear coat that prevents graffiti paint from seeping though to lower layers and is particularly resistant against harsh detergents. The Berlin S-Bahn has tested this system over a period of five years with excellent results. After numerous graffiti removal procedures and wash cycles the coating is still perfectly intact. Thus, maintenance costs are reduced and less frequent re-coating also reduces the strain on the environment.\nKANSAI HELIOS: the one-stop shop for all coating materials\nTo achieve a perfect finish on all interior and exterior surfaces of a rail vehicle, many different products are needed: liquid coatings, powder coatings, UHS systems, e-coats, sealants, putties, adhesives – you name it. All these products have to be compatible with each other and ideally be of exactly the same colour and gloss. KANSAI HELIOS has it all. As a system supplier it is a one-stop shop offering a product range which comprises all the materials needed for a rail coating task. The advantage for our customers: all products from liquid to powder and putty can be combined with each other and colour and gloss always match perfectly. Furthermore, KANSAI HELIOS offers technical support for all products and helps customers find the optimal combination for each individual coating task.\nExplore KANSAI HELIOS Industrial Coating solutions under www.kansaihelios-industrialcoatings.com.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(46,'Railway PRO','Digital rail freight solution to gain efficiency, cost savings and more safety','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/digital-rail-freight-solution-to-gain-efficiency-cost-savings-and-more-safety/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230629_102805-326x245.jpg','August 31, 2023','2023-09-20 16:38:18','European rail freight has to cope with great challenge. Due to demographic change, the already existing shortage of manpower will become even more acute. This means that in the future, more transport volume will have to be managed with fewer human resources. This can be realised through a digital transformation of European rail transport, which has already found its way into innovative railway companies such as SBB Cargo or Mercitalia. An essential technology for this comes from PJM. The WaggonTracker, a unique digital overall system, monitors important functions of goods trains and automates time-consuming, manual processes (such as the brake test). As a best practice example, the pilot train of Mercitalia Intermodal is described here, which has already been in operation for 18 months and has proven itself very well.\nItaly’s largest intermodal operator, Mercitalia Intermodal S.p.A, is one of the most innovative and leading railway companies. In order to increase the transport quality and performance of intermodal transport, Mercitalia Intermodal 2021 decided to invest in further technological innovations. Specifically, the project called for the digital upgrade of a pilot intermodal train to meet the numerous requirements, such as increasing terminal capacities and shorten turnaround times, optimizing train preparation, minimizing manual activities on the track etc.\nThe solution\nThe solution concept of PJ Monitoring GmbH was convincing, as it was able to fulfil all the above-mentioned requirements with only one system. Through numerous and specifically defined monitoring functions and the use of automated processes, which were able to replace the previously tedious and manual activities, the result demanded by the customer, “increased efficiency”, was achieved in all required aspects.\nSome of the functionalities are unique and were used for the first time in this project. The project included conception and development of the technical functionalities, implementation of the digital system on a pilot train and then data evaluation and analysis during the approximately 18-month operating phase of the test train.\nThe technical centrepiece was the overall digital system “WaggonTracker”. This platform is equipped with a wheel hub generator that supplies freight wagons with sufficient and autonomous power. The monitoring data is collected by means of sensors (e.g. brake cylinder pressure, measurement of forces in the brake linkage, etc.). A local radio system ensures secure long-distance communication with all wagons, via an encrypted, secure connection. Due to the powerful power supply and the technical design, the platform is freely scalable and thus expandable for customer-specific requirements. The WaggonTracker system is the only system worldwide that combines comprehensive monitoring functions and automated processes such as automatic brake testing or load weight monitoring.\nThe features\n– Real-time trestle monitoring for reliable and safe detection of the correct setting for trailer transports in the intermodal sector incl. driver warning if the status of the trestle changes during the journey\n– Brake monitoring: Real-time brake analysis and brake system monitoring with regard to the correct functionality of the brake, monitoring of the correct cylinder pressures depending on the cradle valve status at standstill and during travel, brake energy calculation per brake cylinder to determine the overall system wear and to detect the overload of the brake system\n– Determination of driving comfort, driving stability and driving safety\n– Monitoring of longitudinal, transverse and vertical impacts and their coordinates if limit values are exceeded\n– Load weight monitoring to ensure that the vehicle is correctly and properly loaded\n– General monitoring functions such as mileage, direction of travel, position data, historical data, last message, last movement, geofencing (monitoring of vehicle fleets within a predefined area)\n– Automated brake test: As part of the brake test developed with SBB Cargo and RCG, the brake condition is checked automatically with the brake test system. Relevant data from the goods train is collected via a functionally safe measuring technique and displayed in real time in a clear and user-friendly manner on the train driver’s or brake tester’s mobile operating device. Thus, the operational brake test can be carried out remotely by one person in a short time. Multiple rounds around the train are no longer necessary. The automated brake test fulfils all safety-relevant requirements in terms of operation and vehicle and is the reference system for automated brake tests on freight wagons in Europe.\nThe advantages\nCost savings\n– The load weight monitoring ensures that the goods train is loaded in the best possible way and that the loading capacity is used to the maximum. At the same time, overloading is ruled out, and with it the possibility of a line-out at infrastructure measuring points.\n– The comprehensive, condition-based monitoring prevents any future damage to the vehicle and thus saves cost-intensive repairs. Using predictive measurement data analyses, maintenance and workshop visits can be effectively planned in terms of timing and location, which is also a significant cost benefit.\n– Typical cost-intensive problems can be avoided by integrating the system into the operation, e.g. flat spots caused by applied hand brakes, brakes that are not fully released when starting and dragging brakes while driving.\n– Costs are also saved by automating previously laborious, manual processes. An essential aspect here is that the cost savings have an immediate effect, but there are also cost benefits in the medium and long term.\nIncreasing safety\nThe automated check of the brakes or the load weight as well as the monitoring functionalities bring more safety in rail freight transport. Overloaded or asymmetrically loaded freight wagons mean a higher risk during the journey, but are a thing of the past with automatic load weight monitoring. Derailment diagnosis, king-pin monitoring and axle bearing temperature monitoring are also essential safety-relevant data that are recorded in real time and warn the train driver via In-Train communication in the event of critical deviations during the journey, e.g. if the brake system of individual wagons is overloaded, the axle bearing temperature is outside the normal range, the interlocks of a trestle change their status (i.e. open) or wagons threaten to derail or have derailed.\nTime saving\nAutomated brake testing and load weight monitoring provide rail operators with effective and immediate time savings. Automated brake testing of a 500 m goods train typically takes 5 minutes instead of up to 40 minutes with less manpower. This reduces turnaround times and optimises and increases terminal and driver capacities. Thanks to the comprehensive monitoring functionalities, short-term and thus time-consuming repairs can be avoided. The reliability of the fleet is increased and fewer replacement vehicles are needed. Workshop times are reduced so that the vehicles are actually “vehicles” (and not “standing vehicles”). The automatic load weight control avoids time-consuming check-out at checkpoints. The resulting time reserves counteract operational delays or infrastructure failures and still help to arrive on time. This means that time-critical goods can also be transported by rail, which is essential for increasing the modal split.\nPreventive avoidance of damage and repairs\n– Since the introduction of the trestle monitoring, Mercitalia Intermodal has recorded a striking reduction of 70% in damage. Incorrect handling by third parties can now be objectively determined and proven (previously data-based proof was not possible). Subsequently, damage is prevented through targeted staff training. Damage that nevertheless occurs can be charged to the person who caused it.\n– The number of unplanned removing wagons from the train at checkpoints caused by overloading has been significantly reduced by the load weight monitoring. Deployments at infrastructure points are time-consuming and cost-intensive.\n– The overall performance of the pilot train has increased significantly because the train is less likely to record unscheduled stoppages or even failures, which can be detected and prevented in time through the targeted monitoring. If only one component is not working (e.g. trestle / kingpin or brake), the entire train comes to a standstill.\nRealisation of one-person operation\nThe digital “all-round equipment” enables the so-called one-person operation. This means that freight train movements can be carried out and organised by the locomotive driver alone, without the need for the shunting staff that has been common up to now. Due to the increasing shortage of skilled workers, the automation of manual, strenuous and completely unattractive work steps is crucial in order to be able to guarantee efficient operations.\nPJM at a glance\nPJM is an internationally renowned system specialist for rail transport and has successfully implemented projects in 30 countries on 6 continents.\nPJ Monitoring GmbH is a technology leader in the digitalisation of rail transport.

SRL East will be open by 2035 when will have six new underground stations providing better access to people in Melbourne neighbourhoods.\nThe Suburban Rail Loop is a 90 km rail line linking every major train service from the Frankston Line to the Werribee Line via Melbourne Airport, better connecting Victorians to jobs, retail, education, health services and each other.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(49,'Railway PRO','USD 2.4 billion investment for Melbourne tram system','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/usd-2-4-billion-investment-for-melbourne-tram-system/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Yarra-LRVs-326x245.jpg','August 31, 2023','2023-09-20 16:38:32','The Government of the State of Victoria has launched the Melbourne Tram Plan, with an investment of AUD 3.8 billion (USD 2.4 billion) to be used for new trams, accessible stops, and better transport services across the city.\nTram stop upgrades will be carried out along Footscra – Maribyrnong, Thornbury – Northcote and Fitzroy – Collingwood corridors which will be operated by the next generation of low-floor trams. These three corridors are situated in the central part of Melbourne and give passengers access to the new Footscray Hospital, Victoria University, Northcote Plaza, Australian Catholic University, schools, and busy cafes bars and restaurants.\nThe strategy includes projects to make stations more accessible and efficient and provides measures to deliver increased frequency, capacity and reliability, while cutting travel times across the network.\n“This plan sets out our vision for a modern tram network and we want to hear from people who travel along these critical tram corridors, to help us plan for improvements that will make the biggest difference to you,” the Minister for Public Transport Ben Carroll said.\nThe tram strategy builds on a track record of investment and sets out authorities’ projects and measures to create a more accessible and interconnected network which will support high frequency services on the main important corridors providing passengers a turn up and go service.\nThis strategy includes actions to improve and expand the access to tramway system and along with the Victoria’s Bus Plan, it provides communities, industry and government the blueprint for the future of the transport network.\nThe authorities now invite the community until 15 October to help shaping tram stop upgrades in city’s north and west as part of improvements to make sure tram travel is accessible for everyone across the network.\nSince 2014, the government has delivered 83 level access tram stops with a further 12 in progress along Latrobe Street that are due to be completed in 2024 thanks to an investment of AUD 68 million (USD 44 million) provided under the Victorian budget 2022/2023.\nIn the last budget, the government invested more than AUD 60 million (USD 39 million) for infrastructure projects to enable the first 10 next generation trams to start rolling out on to the network including safety and minor accessibility improvements and a new terminus along routes 57, 59 and 82 in Melbourne’s west.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nIn addition, the government committed a AUD 1.85 billion (USD 1.2 billion) investment for the acquisition of 100 light rail vehicles and the construction of a new tram maintenance facility in Maidstone, 10 km north-west of city centre. The facility will be able to accommodate up to 60 next generation trams and is expected to be inaugurated in 2026. In June, a consortium led by John Holland Group won the contract to build the tram maintenance and stabling facility. In 2022, Alstom won a EUR 700 million contract for the supply of 100 Flexity 2 light rail vehicles for Melbourne’s network. They will replace the existing high-floor trams providing modern, inclusive, safe and reliable transport services. The new fleet will further support the increase in network capacity requirements to meet the projected population growth.\nThe Melbourne Tram Plan is developed considering the government’s Big Build programme which invests AUD 90 billion (USD 58 billion) through 165 major road and rail projects across the state.\nMelbourne’s 250 km double track tram system is the largest operational network in the world operated by 520 vehicles. The system served by 1,700 tram stops, including 450 accessible stops, ensures more than 200 million trips per year.\nAccording to official forecasts, the population of Melbourne, particularly in the inner area will grow strongly in the next decades putting pressure on the transport system. Concerning the tramway services, the demand will increase and with a forecast of doubling daily tram trips by 2046. Thus, creating additional capacity, expanding the network and modernising Melbourne tram infrastructure and stops, along with the services, are the best options to deliver a strong network that will meet future demand.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(50,'Railway PRO','India launched station modernisation programme','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/india-launched-station-modernisation-programme/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/India-PM-station-programme-official-ceremony-326x245.png','August 31, 2023','2023-09-20 16:38:36','India is starting a rail station development programme called ‘Amrit Bharat Railway Stations’, launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 6, 2023, via a video conference.\nThe entire project covers redevelopment works at 1,309 stations across the country with the first 508 train stations across 27 states and union territories* to need an investment of Rs 24,470 crores (USD 3 billion).\nThe ceremony to launch the modernisation works was attended by the Railway Minister, Ashwani Vaishnawji, members of the Union Cabinet from country’s regions, governors of various states, Chief Ministers, Ministers of State Cabinets, and other officials.\nMaster plans are being prepared for the development of these stations as ‘City Centres’, which will better integrate cities’ landscape and public transport system creating an urban approach centered around the railway station.\n“The redevelopment project will be a huge campaign for infrastructure development in the country along with the railway infrastructure that will bring benefits to all states in the country,” the prime minister said.\nThe redevelopment will provide modern passenger amenities along with ensuring better traffic management, intermodal integration and signage particularly for passengers with reduced mobility.  Works at the selected stations will include the modernisation of buildings, new platforms and better seating areas, upgraded waiting rooms and free Wi-Fi.\n \n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe programme aims at delivering more comfort and capacity for passengers as well as increasing tourism which will all boost the economic activities in the regions. The projects will be carried out on a ‘one station one product’ scheme that will help artisans and local companies to grow, while will keep each region’s tradition and brand. “The stations will present a glimpse of India’s cultural and local heritage and will be a symbol of the modern aspirations of the country along with its ancient heritage,” the Prime Minister emphasised.\nDuring his speech, the Prime Minister underlined the importance of the rail infrastructure expansion. In the last decade, “the length of track laid in the country is more than the combined railway network in South Africa, Ukraine, Poland, the UK and Sweden. In the last year alone, India laid more railway tracks than the combined railway network of South Korea, New Zealand and Australia. Today, the government is working to make the rail journey accessible as well as pleasant. The effort is to provide the best possible experience from train to station,” Narendra Modi said.\nRailway sector is essential for India’s transport system and its economy. This year, railways received a budget of more than Rs 2.5 lakh crores (about USD 30 billion), a five-fold increase as compared to 2014. In addition, locomotive production increased by 9 times in the last nine years and the manufacturing of HLB coaches increased by 13 times.\nIn the Northeast of the country, work is ongoing to double the single track lines, gauge conversion, electrification and construction of new railway lines, “commissioning of new railway lines in the region has increased three times”.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nSince 2014, India has built 2,200 km of tracks of the freight corridor network reducing travel time. The cargoes reach western ports from Delhi NCR in 24 hours from previously 72 hours. 40% of time reduction is also recorded on other routes.\nAs India is on its decarbonisation path, national authorities plan to make railways more environment friendly to reduce carbon emissions relying on the electrification of the lines. “100 percent rail line electrification will be achieved very soon which will result in all the trains in India running only on electricity. The stations that generate electricity from solar panels has increased to more than 1200 in the last 9 years,” Modi explained.\nThe government aims to produce green energy at each railway station in the near future and to install LED lights at the stations as well as on 70,000 coaches to reduce consumption. Based on green electricity, the stations to be developed under the new programme will meet the standards of green buildings. By 2030, India railway sector would run on zero emissions.\nThis year, India has signed important contracts to modernise its railway sector. A USD 6.5 billion contract was awarded to Kinet Railway Solutions consortium for the design and supply of Vande Bharat electric trains with 16 cars each. The consortium was established by Transmashholding (TMH), Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) and Locomotive Electronic Systems (LES) which will be also responsible for the maintenance of the new trains for 35 years.\nAt the beginning of 2023, Indian Railways and Siemens Mobility signed a contract for the supply of 1,200 locomotives, including full service maintenance for 35 years. Siemens will be also in charge for locomotive testing and deliveries are scheduled to take place over a period of 11 years. The 9,000 horsepower (HP) locomotives which will be locally produced at Siemens plants, will be capable of hauling loads of 4,500 tonnes running at a speed of 120 km/h.\nIn addition, the rolling stock of Indian Railways is constantly renewed as Wabtec delivered the 500th Evolution Series locomotive manufactured at manufacturer’s plant in Marhowra, Bihar.\nAlstom has also delivered Indian Railways the 300th WAG12B electric locomotive, under the EUR 3.5 billion contract for the supply of 800 high-powered double-section locomotives. The vehicles are designed to have a maximum speed of 120 km/h hauling 6,000 tonnes.\n \n*The rail station development programme includes 55 stations in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, 49 in Bihar, 44 in Maharashtra, 37 in West Bengal, 34 in Madhya Pradesh, 32 in Assam, 25 in Odisha, 22 in Punjab, 21 each in Gujarat and Telangana, 20 in Jharkhand, 18 each in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, 15 in Haryana, 13 in Karnataka among others.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(51,'Railway PRO','EUR 47 billion for rail projects in South Italy','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/eur-47-billion-for-rail-projects-in-south-italy/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Webuild-Sicily-326x245.jpg','August 30, 2023','2023-09-20 16:38:44','Italy’s Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Matteo Salvini, has announced that an investment of EUR 47 billion will be provided to revitalise Calabria and Sicilia railway networks, in the south part of the country.\nThe minister said that in Sicily the railway system will benefit a EUR 13 billion investment which will support, among others, the construction of Palermo – Catania – Messina railway line, the rehabilitation and electrification of Palermo – Trapani line via Milo, the rail connections with the Trapani Birgi (in Sicily) and Fontanarossa (in Catania) airports as well as the modernisation of Caltagirone-Gela rail line.\nIn Calabria, an investment plan of EUR 34.8 billion is envisaged for the railway network, EUR 16 billion of which is already funded and includes EUR 15.9 billion for Salerno – Reggio Calabria line and EUR 230 million for technological upgrade of Battipaglia and Reggio Calabria connection, the “variant of Cannitello” and Rosarno – San Ferdinando line.\nThe Italy National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) is focusing the financing of the projects to remove of the missing links of the transport connection between north and south. The Calabria and Sicilia railway networks will be improved, electrified and developed to create the needed cohesion between the two and to boost productivity in the south region, thus reducing the north-south gap.\nThe Mission 3 Component 1 – “Investment on railway networks” of the NRRP consists of the improvement of high-speed / high-capacity network for faster rail services for both passenger and freight, the completion of the TEN-T corridors and other essential routes, with a special attention on the south region of Italy.\nOf the EUR 27.97 billion investment for railway transport, 45% representing EUR 23.8 billion will be used for railway modernisation and expansion in the south.\nAccording to FS Italiane business plan for 2021 – 2026, the NRRP target in the region for the high-speed rail projects consists of 69 km of new connections by June 2024 and 274 km by June 2026.\nThere are three high-speed rail projects to be implemented in this area including Napoli – Bari, Palermo – Catania – Messina and Salerno – Reggio Calabri lines.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe first phase of the construction of the 250 km Napoli – Bari line will be completed in 2026 and the project will be entirely completed after 2026. The project is divided into four sub-projects which consists of the construction of a variant to the current Napoli – Cancello line for a total length of 15.5 km passing through the Napoli Afragola HS station, the construction of the second track of the old line between Cancello and Frasso Telesino and Frasso Telesino – Vitulano for a length of 46 km and the removal of 25 level crossings, doubling the Orsara – Bovino rail section and the 47 km Apice – Orsara line section expected to be completed in 2026.\nRehabilitation and modernisation works are also planned for the train stations along the Napoli – Bari line including the deployment of new technologies and systems for traffic management.\nThe line will be equipped with ERTMS L2 allowing trains to run at 250 km/h.\nThe construction of the new Palermo – Catania – Messina rail line, on the Scandinavia – Mediterranean Corridor, is split into two main sections: Palermo – Catania and Catania – Messina.\nThe new 70 km Palermo – Catania line will be a mix of double (Fiumetorto – Lercara branch line and Catenanuova – Bicocca sections) and single track sections, while maintaining the existing connection. In March, the European Commission committed a EUR 3.4 billion funding to support the modernisation of 178 km of tracks between Fiumetorto and Bicocca, part of Palermo – Catania. The European Investment Bank approved a EUR 2.1 billion funding which includes a direct EUR 800 million funding to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and a EUR 1.3 billion counter-guarantee designed in conjunction with FS Italiane. A 50% counter-guarantee is backed by the InvestEU programme and enables the guarantees to be doubled to EUR 2.6 billion. When added to the financing granted to the MEF, this brings the value of the resources activated to EUR 3.4 billion. In addition, the project is also supported by the Recovery and Resilience Plan with EUR 1.4 billion.\nWhen complete, in 2026, the project will reduce the current travel time by about 60′, connecting the two metropolitan cities in 2 hours compared to the current 3 hours.\nThe Catania – Messina project covers a double track on Giampilieri – Fiumefreddo as a variant to the current line for an extension of about 42 km. Compared to the single-track line currently in operation, parallel to the coast, the new route is developed upstream of the current one with the simultaneous construction of new service locations. This section is scheduled to be completed after 2026.\nThe entire 223 km line will be equipped with ERTMS Level 2 and is estimated at EUR 11.2 billion. The trains will run at 200 km/h.\nIn Calabria, the Salerno – Reggio Calabria rail project covers the construction of a new high-speed high-capacity line to be used by both passenger and freight trains connecting the north and south of the country.\nThe project is split into several lots including the Battipaglia – Romagnano which will improve Battipaglia – Potenza connection and completed in 2026, and Praja – Tarsia with interconnection with the Metaponto – Sibari line expected to be completed in 2030; Tarsia – Montalto and Montalto – Lamezia Terme (lot 3 and lot 4 respectively).\nThe 207 km Salerno – Reggio Calabria project is estimated at more than EUR 13 billion and when completed, the trains will be able to run at 200-300 km/h. The project will increase transport capacity and connectivity along the north-south axis and will provide improved connections to and from Sicily.\nUpgrade and electrification projects \nAlso, for the Calabria and Sicilia railway networks the projects involve upgrades, electrification and the increase of capacity and train frequency through nine projects to be implemented.\nOn the Ionian railway line linking Sibari and Catanzaro Lido stations electrification is ongoing which also extends the Catanzaro Lido – Lamezia Terme Centrale cross-section line both of them being technologically upgraded to improve reliability and the management of the signalling systems.\nIn addition, other works are planned to include adaptation of works on sections of line to increase maximum speeds, technological upgrade to further sections of the line south of Catanzaro Lido, the electrification of Catanzaro Lido – Melito Porto Salvo line and adaption of Cutro tunnel.\nAs part of rehabilitation of railway network in Molise, in Southern Italy, FS Italiane is upgrading the 171 km Venafro – Campobasso – Termoli single and non-electrified line. Electrification works are ongoing and further plans for the project consists of technological upgrade with multi-station computerised control equipment (on Venafro-Matrice – Termoli section), the electrification of Termoli – Matrice section, and new track layout at the stations on the Venafro – Termoli section.\nPalermo – Agrigento – Porto Empedocle upgrade is another project to be implemented to improve the railway network in the south. The project consists of increasing the performance of the 59 km Lercara Dirammmazione – Agrigento Centrale section of Palermo – Agrigento Centrale line, which will be upgraded to increase the axle load to allow heavier trains. This line also includes the 10 km Agrigento Bassa – Porto Empedocle section for which track upgrade, redevelopment, and technological improvement works are planned.\nThese two sections will be equipped with multi-station computerised control equipment (ACCM) and ERTMS Level 2.\nThe connection with Trapani Birgi airport involves two branches that will converge in a siding station close to the airport terminal. A 2 km rail section will provide connection between the airport and Trapani-Marsala and a branching off from the current Palermo – Trapani line (via Castelvetrano). This configuration will ensure the connection of the airport terminal both in the direction of Trapani and Castelvetrano and will promote rail-air intermodality.\nAnother air-rail project comprises the connection to Olbia airport covering the construction of a line which ensures the link with the national rail network. The connection also includes a 7 km direct link to the line existing Olbia – Ozieri Chilivani line.\nFS Italiane will also carry out works to double the Decimomannu – Villamassargia line with the first phase between Decimomannu and Siliqua to be completed in 2026. The entire projects consists of the construction of a double track of 30 km, the removal of the existing level crossings and the installation of a a remote command and control system with ACCM and SCC-M technology (multi-station command and control system).\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe construction of Bari Lamasinata new station will be designed for 750-metre freight trains which will benefit connection to the Scandinavian – Mediterranean Corridor. in the first phase, 7.7 km pass-through tracks will be constructed and two additional tracks to Bari – Foggia line, the installation of traffic management system at the new station. Under the second phase, the final 8.7 km long pass-through tracks and further 4.7 km sidings will be constructed. The project will increase the capacity and access to heavier trains while reducing the time and costs of the shunting activities.\nAugusta bypass covers the construction of a rail connection between Brucoli and Priolo stations and a new station to eliminate freight trains to reach the city centre. The new single electrified track will reduce the length of the route by 4 km between the two stations.\nThe double tracking of Albairate – Abbiategrasso line is also included in the FS Italiane 2021-2026 commercial plan and includes the implementation of the second phase of the project. This involves the construction of a 5 km second track between Albairate Vermezzo and Abbiategrasso, part of Milano – Mortara railway line as well as the removal of the existing level crossings.\nAt Albairate Vermezzo and Abbiategrasso stations the track layout will be changed and the existing platforms will be adapted to standard track length and height. At Abbiategrasso two new tracks will be built for rolling stock shunting activities which will allow fast connections for suburban rail services.\nNew signalling systems will be deployed to ensure the management of rail traffic and increase traffic safety and capacity.\nModernised stations and hubs \nBesides these projects, the Calabria and Sicilia railway networks will benefit improved and rehabilitated stations with the NRRP target for the south project targeting 10 modernised stations by 2024 and 54 stations by 2026.\nThis programme is split into two main projects consisting of upgrade, the improvement of the accessibility and intermodality, and the establishment of intermodal hubs and metro lines to support the development of sustainable mobility.\nFS Italiane will improve accessibility and intermodality at 45 strategic stations by 2026 which will improve daily passenger ridership and will attract more tourists to use railway services. The works will be carried out for passenger buildings, platforms, shelters, underpasses / overpasses, installation of access facilities in particular for people with reduced mobility, as well as the development of stations’ surrounding areas.\nThe second component of the project includes large-scale interventions to develop transport hubs, for which Italy has already selected the strategic stations which include Messina, Benevento, Bari, Lecce, as well as the stations on the Napoli metro Line 2, to integrate heavy rail and urban rail connections which will increase the attractivity of sustainable transport. The projects will include station development works, creating facility for increased accessibility, energy efficiency for each station, and promoting rail hubs and urban stops as the most important points of the city for a fast and green mobility. These projects will be implemented by FS Italiane in collaboration with local authorities and will involve companies interested to redevelop the station and integrate rail connections to create an integrated and sustainable transport in the benefit of the society.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(52,'Railway PRO','Changes in Keolis management.

The two bridges over Sand Creek and Bridge Street in Sandpoint run parallel to each other, approximately 50 feet (15 metres) apart.\nThe original rail bridge was 1.45 km long (4,769 feet). In Sandpoint, BNSF’s mainline track merges with Montana Rail Link, which created a bottleneck of multiple tracks merging into a single track across Lake Pend Oreille. Since only one train could cross at a time, trains were often staged, leaving them idling and blocking local roadways while waiting to cross.\nThe new rail bridge was completed in late 2022 and opened to rail service in November, nearly a year ahead of schedule. The completion of the new bridge allowed BNSF to begin a modernisation project on the original bridge, built in 1904. It has been under construction since last year and has been closed for maintenance upgrades until now. New bridges over Sand Creek and Bridge Street in Sandpoint were also constructed.\nThe inauguration of the Sandpoint Junction Connector rail bridge “is a big win for our customers and the community, especially before the start of the fall harvest season. This bridge will be critical moving forward to address our long-term growth and will allow us to meet customer expectations for the next century or more,” John Cech, vice president of engineering for BNSF said.\nThe upgrades will reduce congestion and help move current and future freight traffic more efficiently, significantly reducing idle times for trains.

But the engineers used a different approach at Moorhall Road to allow the closure to coincide with the school summer holidays when traffic is lighter.\nConstruction of the HS2 project, which is designed to improve rail links between London, Birmingham and the north, will help boost the economy and provide a low carbon alternative to car and air travel. It is approaching the peak of construction activity, with more than 29,000 jobs supported by the project across the UK.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\n“HS2 will transform journeys across the UK, boosting the economy and unlocking more space on our existing rail network.

The winner of the architectural competition will be announced in the first half of next year.\nThe terminal will provide connection to the fast rail services on the Prague – Brno route and will have a park and ride facility with connection to all public transport services. Thanks to its convenient location on the outskirts of the city, the terminal will also be connected to the Jihlava – Havlíčkův Brod regional line and the adjacent D1 highway. The uniqueness of this architectural competition is the design of a multi-storey terminal, in which the existing line will intersect with the future high-speed line. Its location was selected to significantly increase the mobility of the residents of the Vysočina Region, in the south-eastern part of the historical region of Bohemia.\nThe competition also includes a bridge over the D1 highway with a span of more than 160 metres and the development of an urban conceptual design which will offer a wide range of options for solutions around the terminal.\nSZ says that the “experience from abroad shows that the vicinity of terminals on the outskirts of cities can experience rapid development in the coming years if there is a quality infrastructure connection.”\nThe terminal in the Jihlava-Pávov municipality is part of the new railway connection from Prague to Brno. It will be constructed on the prepared route Vysočina phase II section between Světla nad Sázavou and Velka Bíteš. Vysočina high-speed line is divided into two phases. The first involves the construction of the Velká Bíteš – Brno section, the second then the construction of the Světlá nad Sázavou – Velká Bíteš section, thus, the entire Prague – Brno high-speed line will be completed. It will allow passenger trains to run at 320 km/h and will provide connections with the express and regional rail services. The 80-km Vysočina phase II section should be built between 2029 and 2034.\nThe future Prague – Brno high speed rail will be extended to Ostrava that will provide cross-border connection with Poland towards Katowice, as well as to Břeclav (south of Brno) which will ensure the connection towards Austria (in Vienna) and Slovakia, in Bratislava. The project connecting Brno and Břeclav consists of the construction of the Brno – Rakvice high-speed rail section and the modernisation the existing line Břeclav. The “Y” shaped Prague – Brno – Ostrava/ Břeclav will be the main high-speed rail corridor in the Czech Republic to be connected to the network of the Central Europe also allowing connections to Budapest or Warsaw. This line will connect Czechia’s three largest cities and will also serve Jihlava, Olomouc and other regional centres.\nThe high-speed line between Prague and Brno will reduce travel time from three hours to 50 minutes and will attract up to 60,000 passengers a day, according to the transport model of the project. in addition, the line is designed to provide links with the existing existing regional lines.\nThe high-speed rail terminal in Jihlava is the third one to be designed after Prague East VRT and Roudnice nad Labem interchange hubs.\nIn August 2022, SZ awarded Rusina Frei architekti a contract for the design of Roudnice nad Labem interchange hub to be constructed on the Podřipsko high-speed rail section linking Praha and Lovosice.

The Delta Junction is HS2’s key interchange where the new zero-carbon high speed railway will connect between London, the Midlands and the North,” HS2 Senior Project Manager for Delta Junction, Sam Hinkley said.\nReaching 20 metres tall at its highest point, the two Water Orton Viaducts will be amongst the tallest structures along the HS2 route, taking trains over key transport corridors including the M42, the Birmingham to Peterborough rail line and the River Tame.\nThe pier was built in situ with a bespoke formwork designed specifically for the project, and with a fully prefabricated reinforcement cage, assembled in the rebar factory located near Coleshill.\nThe piers will support the deck, which will be built using an innovative construction method and bespoke machinery. The deck segments will be produced at HS2’s nearby outdoor purpose-built Kingsbury factory near Lea Marston. The factory is making a total of 2,742 segments for the entire Delta Junction, generating over 6km of post tensioned viaduct. The segments will be transported to site using haul roads to reduce HS2’s impacts on local roads.\nTo reduce environmental impacts, HS2’s engineers have incorporated Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS) – a by-product of the steel manufacturing industry – into the structures as an eco-friendly concrete alternative to a traditional concrete mix, reducing carbon use by more than 60%.\nAfter the piers are constructed, the viaduct spans will be built by raising each segment from a temporary suspension tower erected on top of each pier. When each span is complete, the suspension tower will be disassembled and moved further along the viaduct to build the next span.\nAn innovative ‘match-casting’ technique means that each viaduct segment is cast against the following segment in a production line, creating a seamless viaduct deck when installed.

In this case, the ARTC studied two options covering bridge replacing and track realignment as part of a station modification. Following public consultation, the preferred option is to realign the track and modify the station precinct. The tracks will be relocated on the south side of the station (Mackellar Street side) to the north side (Railway Place side) of the station, and the road overpass at Benalla Station will be removed.\nWorks for bridges will be carried out at the sites in Wandong, Tallarook, Seymour, Euroa and in three sites will be located Broadford for three bridges. Most of the existing bridges will be replaced either safer but higher bridge structure, either a new bridge, an underpass or where these structures are not complying, the tracks will be lowered.\nThe Beveridge – Albury rail section, in North East Victoria, includes upgrading 262 km of existing rail track between Beveridge, north of Melbourne, and the Victoria-NSW border at Albury-Wodonga. The construction works will be varied out at 12 sites along the North East rail and delivered into two phases.

The decision was made by the Council of Ministers on August 16, 2023, and is a continuation of the rail projects to create a safe, fast and modern infrastructure across the country.\nPLN 170 billion (EUR 38 billion) is the total value of the new strategy which includes PLN 79 billion (EUR 17.6 billion) for the ongoing projects started in 2014-2020, PLN 80 billion (EUR 17.8 billion) will be invested in the 2021-2027 perspective and PLN 11 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) will be used under the scope of the National Reconstruction Plan (KPO).\nThe 2023 rail investment strategy was adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2015 with an investment of PLN 67 billion (EUR 15 billion in current prices).\n“The adoption of a new programme means a new boost for railway investments in the country. I am sure that thanks to this, rail transport in Poland will continue to develop dynamically, as it has been doing since 2015,” the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk said.\nAs part of the Polish National Railway Programme until 2030, it is planned to maintain high and stable outlays for railway investments. Within the next seven years, Poland plans to electrify almost 1,400 km of railway lines which will allow the deployment of electric trains providing modern, comfortable and fast services.\nThe priorities of the 2021-2027 perspective include the completion of major investment projects, such as works on the cross-city line in Warsaw, construction of a tunnel in Łódź, and modernisation of the Gdynia – Słupsk route, the ongoing implementation of the modernisation of key lines on the TEN-T core network such as the Katowice – Zebrzydowice and Białystok – Ełk – Trakiszki which is the connection with Rail Baltica. In addition, the new strategy also includes the construction of new lines in the towns which do not have connections such as Podłęże – Tymbark railway line, the modernisation of the Skierniewice – Łuków or Bydgoszcz – Kościerzyna – Gdynia lines.\nThe aim of the 2030 rail programme is to create faster and reliable connections. For the first time in history, the Polish railway network will allow passenger trains to run at maximum speed of 250 km/h.The first sections to support such services are the Central Rail Line (CMK) which serves Warsaw, Krakow, Katowice, and Wroclaw and the Ełk – Suwałki – state border section, which is part of the international transport corridor E-75 Rail Baltica.\nThe projects to be carried out under the new strategy will also allow passenger trains to run at speeds between 120 and 200 km/h significantly cut the travel times. The focus is on the rail connection from Central Warsaw station to Ełk, to Kołobrzeg, in north-western Poland at the Baltic Sea, and on the route linking Radom, Kielce and Kraków central station, as well as on the Kraków – Nowy Sącz and Bialystok – Gdańsk central station routes.\nThe Polish National Railway Programme “secures financing for important, strategic railway projects. The government’s decision means that Polish railway routes will become even more modern, and passengers will receive an even more interesting and competitive transport offer,” the Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Bittel said.\nPriority projects  \nThe new rail programme also includes projects to improve the railway junctions in southern Poland as when selecting the projects “we are not focused only on the large investments such as the construction of the Podłęże – Piekiełko line or the modernisation of the Warsaw cross-city line. It also means smaller investments, thanks to which the possibilities of rail traffic will increase,” the Minister of Infrastructure highlighted.\nThe projects include the construction of Jedlicze – Szebnie connection, built between the lines No. 106 (which connects Rzeszów with Jasło) and No. 108 (which ensures the connection between Stróże, Jasło, Krosno, Nowy Zagórz, Ustrzyki Dolne and Krościenko). This project is essential to create a direct connection on the route from Rzeszów to the south, towards Krosno and the Bieszczady region without changing trains at Jasło station. Currently, there is no operator that provides services on this route which is unprofitable, and passengers need more than 2 hours to travel between these cities. Following the implementation of the project, rail carriers will be able to launch services providing a direct connection on Rzeszów – Krosno – Nowy Zagórz route, and the travel time that will become attractive. In this way, rail will become an even more frequently chosen means of transport.\nPKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe already has a construction project and obtained permit and an environmental decision for this project. The design and construction tender will be launched by the end of 2023 with works expected to begin in 2025 and completed in 2027.\nThe construction of Gorlice – Zagórzany line is another project that will have a great impact on rail transport. Currently, the railway line No. 110, which reaches the centre of Gorlice, a district town in the province ofLesser Poland, is not used by carriers.The inhabitants are therefore deprived of access to the railway network, except for the possibility of using the peripheral Gorlice Zagórzany station on line 108 (connecting Stróże with Jasło, Krosno and Bieszczady).Carriers do not offer services to the centre of Gorlice, because railway line No. 110 is routed in such a way that passengers can only go directly to Jasło, and it is not possible to go to Stróż, Tarnów and Kraków without changing train.\nThus, the construction of this section betas a connection between lines 108 and 110 will allow trains to run directly from the centre of Gorlice towards Stróż, Tarnów and Kraków without the need to change the head of the train at the Gorlice Zagórzany or other station.By adopting the National Railway Programme, the government provided financing for this investment.\nAs part of the same project, not only a slip road will be built, but also the Gorlice and Gorlice Zagórzany stations will be modernised while the existing line 110 running to the city centre will be revitalised. The design tender is planned to be launched this year and PKP PLK expects permits and decisions to be issued in 2026. The construction works are planned for 2027–2029.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe Warsaw cross-city line is one of the priority projects of the new Polish National Railway Programme consisting in the reconstruction and modernisation of 50 km of tracks, more than 30 engineering structures, including two bridges over the Vistula and two cross-city tunnels on long-distance and suburban lines, the modernisation of Warszawa Śródmieście and Warszawa Ochota stops, as well as the reconstruction of Warsaw Wschodnia and Warsaw Central stations. In addition, PKP PLK will build two new stops (Warsaw Solec and Warsaw Nowy Świat). In January 2023, the rail infrastructure manager has put into operation the first 7 km of this line.\n“Warsaw has been waiting for the modernisation of the Diameter Line for many years and thanks to the government’s decision [to approve the new strategy] it becomes possible,” Andrzej Bittel said.\nThis project will increase transport capacity to 24 pairs of suburban trains and 20 pairs of long-distance trains during peak hours. The construction of the new stops will improve travel comfort as well as the creation of new transfer stations in the area of the Warszawa Śródmieście and Warsaw Wschodnia (Warsaw East station) stations with a link to the metro network.\nThe modernisation of the cross-city line will also consider the adaption to passengers with reduced mobility for which all stations will be equipped with new systems and amenities to provide increased access.\nThe Diameter Line was built from the 1920s to the 1960s and further operation on the existing infrastructure facing technical issues and an increased transport demand would increase the failure rate and negative changes in train traffic.\nPKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe is carrying out works at Warsaw Zachodnia (Warsaw West station) which will be completed in 2024 when tender procedures will be launched for the modernisation of Warsaw Wschodnia station and some selected sections of the cross-city line. From mid-2025 to mid-2027, works will be carried out in the long-distance tunnel, and from mid-2027 to mid-2029 in the suburban tunnel.\nAnother important project part of the national rail strategy covers the construction of the Podłęże – Piekiełko line in southern Poland which has secured financing for implementation. This is one of the essential future connections in Lesser Poland (Małopolska province). The new 60 km Podłęże – Piekiełko line will ensure connection with Szczyrzyc and from here it is split into two branches, one to Tymbark (towards Nowy Sącz) and the other one to Mszana Dolna (towards Chabówka), creating a “Y” shaped link. The two branches, part of the Line 104 will be modernised and the entire project will allow trains to run at 160 km/h. This project will improve rail traffic between Krakow and Zakopane and Nowy Sącz.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n				\n				default\n				\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThanks to its implementation, Nowy Sącz region and in the Beskid Wyspowy region will benefit increased access to railway services. The first phase of this project covers the modernisation of Chabówka – Nowy Sącz connection for which a tedner will be announced in October.\nThe second phase covers the construction of a new line from Podłęże near Kraków to the south to Tymbark and Mszana Dolna.  The construction of the railway line was divided into several phases.\nTender procedures will be launched for the modernisation of line 104 followed by tenders for the northward link. The tenders for the implementation of individual sections are planned to be announced by PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe in 2024 and include Tymbark – Szczyrzyc (tender to be announced in January 2024), Limanowa – Tymbark (in March 2024), and in the third quarter two tenders will be launched for Szczyrzyc – Gdów and Gdów – Podłęże sections. The rail infrastructure manager signed the design contracts in January 2019.\nThe Podłęże – Piekiełko project will increase travel time and will have a great impact to shift road transport towards railways. Currently, rail transport from Krakow to the south is still not competitive with car transport.\nThe train travel time between Kraków and Zakopane in the fastest variant is almost 3 hours, and between Kraków and Nowy Sącz – over 2.5 hours and takes a roundabout route through Tarnów. The new project will provide direct train connection between these towns, significantly reducing travel times. When completed, the new line will reduce train journeys between Krakow and Nowy Sącz to only one hour and travel time from Kraków to Zakopane will be slightly more than 1.5 hours.\nThe new Podłęże – Piekiełko is a missing link on the TEN-T and when completed will also allow fast intermodal and combined freight transport services in a north–south direction on Baltic – Balkans – Black Sea axis creating the RFC 11 Amber corridor.

This enables the route to carry more passengers and freight, and ensures that the trains run more reliably, punctually, and safely.\nOn August 22, 2023, ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG and Siemens Mobility presented in Linz the long-term cooperation agreement and announced the successful commissioning of a first route section, between Linz and Vöcklabruck (57 km).\nÖBB-Infrastruktur AG will invest EUR 200 million in the train control system by 2026, and a total of around EUR 900 million has been earmarked in the framework agreement for ETCS and train controls. A significant innovation in the framework agreement is the use of the DS3 (Distributed Smart Safe System) platform, which has been employed successfully since November 2020 in a pilot project for the interlocking at the Achau railway station in Lower Austria. Thanks to this digitization, ÖBB achieves significantly higher cost-effectiveness through lower investment and maintenance costs.\nThe agreement regulates the expansion of the ETCS Level 2 system throughout Austria’s high-level rail network, the establishment of so-called ETCS Radio Block Centers (RBCs), which will be redundant, and the maintenance and servicing of these facilities. During the project’s rollout, plans call for installing a total of 21 RBCs by 2038 to provide fail-safe coverage for Austria’s high-level rail network.\nETCS Level 2 operation began at the start of August on the Linz–Wels–Vöcklabruck and Wels–Haiding line sections, marking the first commissioning based on the new framework agreement. The ETCS Radio Block Centre covering this section is located in Vienna, and trains operating on the route are digitally monitored and controlled in Linz.\nVienna–Breclav, Vienna–St. Pölten or Kufstein–Brenner routes have been also equipped with the ETCS.\n“Efficient railway infrastructure is critically important for achieving Austria’s climate goals. To help us handle the expected increase in rail traffic and shift away from roads, we are relying extensively on digital initiatives, and ETCS Level 2 is an enormously important component for railways of the future. The framework agreement signed with Siemens Mobility is based on a Europe-wide tender and we’re looking forward now to working with the best bidder to equip further rail routes with Level 2,” Johann Pluy, the CEO of ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG said.\nThe ETCS trackside expansion programme will help respond to increased passenger transport demand.\nThe DS3 is the new software platform from Siemens Mobility for safety-relevant logic and is used to migrate existing applications such as ETCS or interlockings to a standard high-performance platform based on COTS, which uses multicore technology and a new communication concept for a fully IP-based system architecture. DS3 will enable ETCS control centers to be further optimized and given greater flexibility.\nAlong with the coupling computer already running on the DS3 platform, which is the link to the interlockings, the ÖBB and Siemens Mobility partnership will also employ DS3 in all of the RBCs.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(72,'Railway PRO','Amtrak orders additional Siemens trains','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/amtrak-orders-additional-siemens-trains/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Amtrak-Siemens-airo-train-326x245.jpeg','August 23, 2023','2023-09-20 16:40:24','Amtrak ordered 10 additional Airo trainsets from Siemens Mobility exercising an option under the contract signed in 2021 and in total, the operator will own a fleet of 83 Airo trains.\nThe first Amtrak Airo train is scheduled to debut in 2026 and these new trains will operate on routes throughout the country.\n“We are thrilled to satisfy the soaring demand for train travel with new state-of-the-art, American-made equipment that ensures the highest standards of comfort, service and amenities,” Amtrak President Roger Harris said.\nThe trains will provide spacious and comfortable seats with dedicated power, USB-C ports, seatback tablet and phone holders.

The rolling stock manufacturer from Arad is ahead of schedule with the delivery of trams, compared to the schedule agreed in the contract signed with the City Hall.\nThere was a lot of excitement Tuesday morning at the Giurgiu depot of the Bucharest Transport Company (STB), where the Astra Imperio tram number 50 was received, out of the 100 that Astra Vagoane Călători Arad must deliver to the Bucharest municipality. Tram number 51 was parked on a parallel line in the depot and is also due to be put into service soon.\n“We have received trams number 50 and number 51. I would like to remind you that the General Council of Bucharest recently approved the opportunity study for the purchase of another 250 trams, which will provide all the necessary transport. There are serious companies in Romania and when they are paid on time they deliver on time”, said Mayor General Nicușor Dan, obviously referring to Astra Vagoane Călători Arad.\nFor his part, Deputy Mayor Stelian Bujduveanu stressed that there can be no modern transport without investment. “The citizens of Bucharest have started to use public transport, and I’m not just talking about those who don’t have cars.

New trams in figures\nSTB director-general Adrian Criț presented the tram transport situation in Bucharest in figures. From the beginning of the year to 1 August, trams in Bucharest covered a distance of 11.5 million km, of which 1.8 million km were covered by Astra Imperio trams. The latter averaged 33,000 km travelled, while the old V3A or Tatra trams – 27,000 km each. The big difference comes when it comes to maintenance. On Astra Imperio trams maintenance costs 0.21 lei/km, on the others – 5.75 lei/km.\n“Astra has fulfilled its obligations under the contract, despite some doubts. We will deliver five trams ahead of schedule this year. Unfortunately, we have problems in Bucharest, because the infrastructure was modernised 23 years ago, and every eight years we should have done capital repairs. This process has only just started”, said Valer Blidar.\nValer Blidar followed up on Adrian Criț’s idea, saying that it costs him more to maintain his car than the 50 trams delivered to Bucharest. As for some of the problems in running the new trams, he pointed out that each vehicle is fitted with half a million euros worth of electronic equipment, and at first STB drivers were not used to this.

The lot has involved the excavation of approximately 6 km of tunnels running for a total of 240 metres under the bed of the Eisack River. Innovative, state of the art technology was used in its construction. For the Eisack River underpass, one of the most complex sections, the technique of ground consolidation by freezing was adopted, allowing the construction of tunnels where there is a strong presence of groundwater and in full respect of the environment, preserving flora and fauna.\nThe freezing technique, which comes before the excavation phase, ensures the freezing of a portion of soil, between the tunnel to be excavated and the river above, sufficient to make the excavation impermeable to water and ensuring stability. Its application involves a pre-consolidation phase, in which the soil is drilled into the section below the river and its permeability is reduced by cement injections. Next, there is the freezing phase, with the introduction of liquid nitrogen at a temperature of around 196 degrees Celsius below zero: the cooling liquid circulates in the holes made around the excavation perimeter to create a one-metre thick shell. The last stage is where the ice shell is maintained by the use of brine brought to a temperature of between 30°C and 35°C below zero.\nThe Eisack River underpass (lot H71) will contribute to the completion of the Brenner Base Tunnel, which is among the most strategic sustainable mobility projects that Italy is investing in.\nOn the Italian side, in addition to the Eisack underpass lot, the Mules 2-3 lot is being constructed with the Ghella Group. On the Austrian side, it is carrying out work on the Sill – Pfons Gorge lot and has already completed the Tulfes – Pfons lot. In addition to these lots, there are the works for the Fortezza – Ponte Gardena high-capacity line and the Trento railway bypass, for the connection of the line to Fortezza and Trento, respectively.\nThe Brenner Base Tunnel will connect Fortezza, in Italy, to Innsbruck, in Austria. With a total length of 55 km, 64 km if the existing Innsbruck railway bypass is included. When completed, the tunnel will reduce travel time from Fortezza to Innsbruck to 25 minutes for passenger trains, from 80 minutes, and for freight trains to 35 minutes from 105 minutes currently.\n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(83,'Railway PRO','Funding approved for Caltrain BEMU order','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/funding-approved-for-caltrain-bemu-order/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caltrain-EMU--326x245.jpg','August 18, 2023','2023-09-20 16:41:19','The California Transportation Commission has approved funding for one Stadler battery-electric train (BEMU) and related maintenance and charging facility upgrades, enabling Caltrain operator to expand zero emission service to non-electrified tracks.\nThe 4-car vehicle consists of three passenger cars and one battery-head, which houses the battery and power equipment.\nThe authority committed funding from an USD 80 million award from the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) which will allow Caltrain to introduce emission-free trains on both electrified service area of the San Francisco – San José corridor as well as the portion of the corridor from Tamien station in San Jose to Gilroy which is not electrified.\nThe train will be acquired under a contract signed with Stadler for the supply 19 seven-car EMUs and includes an option for a BEMU pilot. If the project will be feasible, Caltrain would order six BEMUs.\nThe BEMU train will charge while the train runs on overhead power in the electrified service areas and then use battery charge to travel “off-wire” on non-electrified track areas. This will lead the way for Caltrain to operate a fully zero-emission service in the future.\n“California continues to lead the transition to a clean, electrified transportation system, this time with the nation’s first battery-electric multiple unit passenger rail train,” California Transportation Secretary Toks Omishakin said.\nBefore this option, Caltrain would have had to use diesel trains on the non-electrified corridor. The funding award from CalSTA also covers the cost of testing at the Transportation Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado, and upgrades to the San Jose Central Maintenance Facility and Gilroy layover and station area to facilitate charging and maintenance.\nThe demonstration of the Stadler battery-electric train in-service will be the first time this bi-level technology is in operation on a commuter train anywhere in the United States. The trainset is also expected to be tested in other intercity and regional rail corridors, if feasible.\n“We’re excited to be the first in the nation to pilot this bi-level hybrid electric and battery service to extend our zero-emission service beyond our electrified service areas. With the BEMU we will not only create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly service, but also faster and more reliable travel times for riders,” Jeff Gee, Caltrain Board Chairman said.\nThe current demonstration plan will have the BEMU charge while in operations between San Francisco and San Jose, and then operate using battery power on non-electrified tracks between San Jose and Gilroy, with intermittent demonstration trips to Salinas. The goal is to show successful service operations and learn from the implementation to provide a roadmap for future BEMU operations and procurements.\nIf successful, BEMUs could replace aging diesel locomotives on non-electrified tracks. This includes potential improved service times to Gilroy resulting from better performance of the BEMU compared to diesel locomotives, improved travel times on the entire corridor and decreased service costs resulting from removing diesel locomotives from service, and increased reliability should overhead power systems fail or utilities experience outages.\nThese EMU trains along with the BEMU demonstration will allow Caltrain to run over 90% of its service with electric trains, benefiting passengers and communities throughout the corridor.\nThe train will go into operation after additional testing and certifications from regulatory agencies.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(84,'Railway PRO','Moscow inaugurates MCD-3 cross-city line','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/moscow-inaugurates-mcd-3-cross-city-line/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Putin-Sobyanin-train-326x245.jpg','August 18, 2023','2023-09-20 16:41:23','The President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin and the Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin have launched on august 17, 2023 the MCD-3, a new Moscow cross-city line, part of the Moscow Central Diameter network..\nThe MCD-3 is a new 85 km long railway line that connects the districts of the north-west and south-east of Moscow. Currently, there are already 38 stations in operation, and three more stations, Mitkovo, Malino, and Rizhskaya, will start the operation later. The MCD-3 passes through 24 districts of Moscow and 4 districts of the Moscow region, providing additional access to the ground metro for approximately 3.5 million residents.\n“I would like to congratulate Moscow on the implementation of another powerful project, which, of course, is in great demand for Muscovites and everyone who comes to the city, works in the city on a daily basis or lives in the nearest suburbs,” Vladimir Putin said at the inauguration ceremony.\nThe construction of the MCD-3 involved creating an entirely new cross-city route to connect previously unconnected directions of the railway. The most challenging part of the project was the construction of the Mitkovskaya section near Elektrozavodskaya metro station on Line 3. Previously, passengers had to create their own routes to Kazansky and Leningradsky railway stations and then transfer to the metro or make a change at the first transfer station when traveling from the south-east to the north-west.\nTo connect different railway directions, a new connecting line called Mitkovo was built, which includes a 400-meter-long tunnel and several large facilities and infrastructure. The project also includes the modern urban railway station Zelenograd-Kryukovo, which meets the standards of the Moscow Transport. Additionally, a station for trains of the high-speed highway St. Petersburg-Moscow will be opened in the future.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe new line is operated by 30 modern trains of which 11 Ivolga trains and 19 EP2D type trains. On traditional suburban routes to Leningradsky and Kazansky railway stations, passengers will be served by 33 Lastochka trains, 18 EP2D trains, and 41 ED4M trains.\nBy 2024, the older generation ED4M trains will be replaced by modern models on the routes to the railway stations. This means that next year, all long-distance suburban routes will be served by an entirely renewed fleet. On the diametral route, 100% new trains are already in operation.\nPassengers can also take advantage of 21 metro interchange options, including the Big Circle Line (BCL), the Moscow Central Circle (MCC), and other diameters. The new Moscow cross-city line is expected to relieve up to 15% of traffic on these three metro lines and reduce harmful emissions into the atmosphere by up to 36 thousand tonnes per year.\nMCD-3 will provide a two-fold increase in the number of passenger seats, from 0.9 to 1.9 million per day and a 1.5 times increase in train frequency, with intervals as short as 5.5 minutes during rush hours.\nFurther plans for the development of passenger transport in Moscow and the Central Transport Hub include the implementation of MCD-5 connection, the modernisation of passenger transport between Moscow and largest cities and the construction of high-speed rail connections. The entire MCD rail system is expected to be completed in 2025.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(85,'Railway PRO','Chile awards contract for 32 commuter EMUs','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/chile-awards-contract-for-32-commuter-emus/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chile-official-winner-326x245.jpg','August 18, 2023','2023-09-20 16:41:27','EFE Trenes de Chile, the state-owned railway company of Chile, announced that CRRC Sifang and Temoinsa won the contract for the supply of 32 commuter EMUs which will be delivered from 2026.\nUSD 171.36 million is the value of the contract, of which USD 117.8 million is the value of the 22 trains ordered for Alameda – Melipilla connection and USD 53.5 millionm for Quinta Normal – Batuco railway line.\nThe three-car trains have a capacity of 807 standing and seated passengers per train and have similar characteristics to those recently acquired for the operation of the Rancagua – Alameda service, powered by electricity through catenary. They will be able to run at a maximum speed of 140 km/h and are equipped with an air conditioning system and will be fully accessible and will have special places for wheelchairs.\nThe winner of the contract was announced by the Minister of Transport and Telecommunications, Juan Carlos Muñoz, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of EFE, Eric Martin, at the Estación Central de Santiago.\n“We are taking a very important step by announcing that the bidding process has finished, which will allow the purchase of new trains that will be used for these two future services that will strengthen public transport in communes that currently have connectivity difficulties, significantly reducing the transfer times, improving people’s quality of life,” Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz said.\n22 of the 32 ordered trains will be used for railway services on Train to Melipilla route, a planned 61 km double-track commuter railway line linking Alameda station in Santiago with Melipilla, a commune situated 70 km south-west of country’s capital. The remaining 10 electric trains will be used on the Quinta Normal Batuco new route, a 27 km railway line from Alameda station, Quinta Normal to Batuco, in the north-west of Santiago.\nThe acquisition of the three-car trains is important to accelerate the two rail projects that “will expand the possibilities of connectivity throughout all the regions. The contract will allow the provision of a safe and environmentally sustainable transport system to communes that today have face issues in rail connectivity located to the west and north of Santiago,” the chairman of the board of EFE Trenes de Chile said.\nThe acquisition of the new electric multiple units is part of a programme supported by the President of Chile Gabriel Boric, which tasked EFE Trenes de Chile to deliver modern railway services and promote sustainable public transport.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe procurement of the new commuter EMUs is the largest single rolling stock contract in the last 140 years, since 1884, when EFE Trenes de Chile was established. It is part of the investment to triple rail passenger ridership expected to reach up to 150 million passengers by 2027. In the case of Melipilla, the company estimated that 57 million passengers will use train services, while Batuco additional 35 million passengers.\nIn January 2022, Chile launched the construction of the stations along the Santiago – Melipilla railway line which will be served by 11 new stations and is expected to enter passenger services from 2026. The Train to Melipilla project has a value of USD 1.5 billion and when completed, the passengers will save up to two hours compared to the current journey time.\nSantiago – Batuco rail project aims to create a 27 km double track for passengers and to improve the existing line, which will be dedicated to freight. Thus the line will be provided with 3 main tracks, two for passenger trains and one freight-dedicated which is not electrified. The line will be served by 7 new stations, including the underground Quinta Normal station to be integrated within the existing metro station. The project also covers the construction of a 1.5 km tunnel, five new underpasses to eliminate the existing grade level crossings and 53 new bridges, as well as a new depot and maintenance facility.\nIn March 2023, Empresa de Ferrocarriles del Estado (EFE) selected a consortium of Systra and Zañartu (50/50), a Chilean engineering firm specialising in civil engineering, to support the construction of the two suburban train lines of Santiago. The contract will runt for five years, until the new lines will enter commercial operation.\nThe acquisition of the new commuter EMUs as well as the construction of the two railway lines are projects implemented under Chile on Rails strategy which includes 27 projects worth more than USD 5 billion.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(86,'Railway PRO','Germany commits EUR 12.5 billion for rail infrastructure','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/germany-commits-eur-12-5-billion-for-rail-infrastructure/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DB-Netz-326x245.jpg','August 17, 2023','2023-09-20 16:41:32','The Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transport (BMDV) announced a budget allocation of EUR 12.5 billion for German railways from the Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF, Der Klima- und Transformationsfonds) as a priority to this “climate-friendly transport mode.”\nAccording to the BMDV, this sector has been “neglected considerably in the past decades” resulting in an “immense investment backlog” that will require an additional funding of up to EUR 45 billion by 2027.\nIn the draft budget for 2024 and the financial planning for the period up to 2027, the ministry has already earmarked an additional EUR 11.5 billion for German railways.\nIn addition, Deutsche Bahn is making its own contribution of EUR 3 billion, financed by a loan on the capital market. “We are also examining whether additional funds can be made available to DB AG via an equity increase to reduce the investment backlog,” BMDV says.\nDue to a decision by the federal government in 2019, the equity of DB AG will be increased by EUR 1.125 billion annually by 2024 to finance the basic rail infrastructure and digitalisation measures. In this respect, the Federal Government will promptly start talks with the EU Commission as to whether additional funds can be made available through further equity measures. “We will do everything we can to continue the massive investment ramp-up in the coming years, with the goal reinforced in the coalition decision of March of making up to EUR 45 billion more available by 2027,” the ministry says.\nAccording to the Federal Minister Volker Wissing, with the financial commitment, “we are moving the rail transport to where it belongs: at the center of modern, sustainable and good mobility. An efficient, reliable, modern, digitized rail network is a prerequisite for goods transport to be reliable and punctual and for people to enjoy traveling by train.”\nThe ministry plans that in September will invite railway and construction industry to discuss the way these funds can be used in the most efficient way in order to quickly achieve noticeable improvements for passengers and freight transport customers.\nDeutsche Bahn is currently working on the modernisation and renovation of the core network. Of the more than 38,000 km of German railways, almost 34,000 km are managed by DB, including the main corridors, which “have been neglected for decades”. Because many opened construction sites, the corridors cannot be fully utilized.\nIn addition, under the Deutschlandtakt, country’s integrated regular interval timetable, Germany plans to build 1,000 km of new railway lines to meet traffic demand and punctuality.\nIn October 2022, BMDV announced that to implement the Deutschlandtakt, there are planned new measures to be implemented with an estimated investment of EUR 26 billion for the North-West.  This includes, among others, the axes Münster – Lünen, Hanover – Hamburg/Bremen, Hanover – Bielefeld, Hamburg – Lübeck – Puttgarden, Brunsbüttel – Wilster as well as the hubs Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.\nAccording to the report of DB for the first half of 2023, published in July, DB’s construction and modernisation projects are “record levels throughout Germany”, causing the decrease of punctuality. In in long distance rail transport, the punctuality fell to 68.7% in the first half of 2023, down from 69.6% in the first half of 2022. “Although we are asking a lot of all stakeholders at the moment, the infrastructure is the key to sustainable improvements for our customers,” Richard Lutz, the CEO of Deutsche Bahn said.\nDB spent considerable funds up front in the infrastructure in the first half of 2023 including much more on maintenance. The company increased its net capital expenditures from its own funds by 13.1% to EUR 3.1 billion in the first six months of 2023, “the most ever invested in the first half of a year.” Gross capital expenditures by DB and the German Government were up 16.7% to EUR 6.3 billion, which is also a record. More than 90% of all funding has continued to go toward rail operations in Germany, including for tracks, stations and new trains.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(87,'Railway PRO','Northern acquires six new train simulators','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/northern-unveils-six-new-train-simulators/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Northern-Rail-326x245.png','August 17, 2023','2023-09-20 16:41:36','The British rail operator Northern will acquire six train simulators from Poland-based firm SIM Factor which will be installed at company’s training academies in 2025.

They will have two separate compartments for carers with a child, friendly for the youngest as the walls and floor covering will be decorated with graphics attractive for children. The seats of the chairs will connect to each other, thanks to which they will form one plane that can be useful. When the seat cushions are raised, the floor of the compartment can turn into a playground. The compartments will have power sockets and USB sockets, and the toilet will be equipped with a changing table for children.\nThe vehicles will also have a non-compartmental area. In one of the vestibules there will be places adapted to transport bicycles and space for vending machines. A comfortable journey around Poland will be ensured by air conditioning, wireless Internet access, sliding doors and a passenger information system. The modernised vehicles will run in trains at speeds of up to 160 km/h.\nThe procurement of the new single-system electric locomotives as well as the modernisation of the Combo carriages are projects part of PKP Intercity’s rolling stock investment strategy under which the entire fleet will be new and modernised by 2030.\nThe Polish rail operator has signed many contracts for new and modernised vehicles to implement its strategy and other are ongoing. In October 2022, the company and Pesa Bydgoszcz signed a contract for the delivery of 16 new diesel-electric locomotives with a maximum speed of 160 km/h in electric traction and 120 km/h in diesel traction. PLN 554.6 million (EUR 124.4 million) is the value of the contract.\nIn March 2023, a contract was concluded with Newag for the purchase of 20 Griffin electric locomotives and in June the operator exercised its option and ordered 5 more locomotives in addition to the ordered 10 new multi-system electric locomotives in October 2021. The value of the order with Newag increased from PLN 258.6 million (EUR 58 million) to nearly PLN 388 million (EUR 87 million).\nIn August 2023, the Polish long-distance operator relaunched a tender to acquire 38 seven-car double-deck trains and 45 multi-system locomotives.\nThe company is also under procurement procedure for the purchase of 300 new long-distance carriages which also includes an option for 150 more such vehicles.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(93,'Railway PRO','Irish Rail awards Alstom contract for train charging facility','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/irish-rail-awards-alstom-contract-for-train-charging-facility/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DART-mock-up-326x245.jpg','August 14, 2023','2023-09-20 16:42:06','Alstom has been awarded a EUR 28 million contract to provide a train charging facility for Irish Rail’s new Battery Electric Multiple Unit (BEMU) trains that will operate between Drogheda, Dublin City Centre and beyond.\nThe fast-charging infrastructure on two platforms and one siding at Drogheda will be installed by end of 2024 to enable new battery-electric DART+ trains that will enter service in 2025, to operate to and from Drogheda in advance of planned electrification of the line, and to be recharged during service turnaround at Drogheda.\n“This investment will allow us to accelerate the benefits of DART+ to customers on the Drogheda commuter route, with a brand-new fleet and extra capacity to be provided in just two years’ time,” Jim Made, CEO of Irish Rail (IE) said.\nThe train charging facility will include a medium voltage connection to ESB (the electricity network operator) and a traction substation converting electricity to the voltage suitable for charging the trains.

The visit also includes an analysis of the situation in the port of Galati.\n\nThe press conference on Ukrainian agricultural exports in the framework of the EU-Ukraine solidarity corridor will be attended by Transport Minister Sorin Grindeanu, Jim O’Brien, who heads the U.S. Sanctions Coordinator, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov, Magda Kopczynska – Director for Water Transport at the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, representatives of the European Commission and Moldovan Agriculture Minister Vladimir Bolea, romanian news agency – Agerpres.ro reports.\nThe meeting takes place in the context that despite the modernization works of the Port of Galati last year there is no possibility of smooth export of Ukrainian grain. Sources consulted explained that out of the four kilometres of modernised railway line to the Port of Galati, only a few kilometres are useful, at least for the time being, to a nearby intermodal terminal from where Ukrainian grain and industrial products leave. But the modernisation work is welcome. Then, as for the actual shipments of grain from the port onto barges, they amount to just a few trains since operations started. The reason for this would be the low capacity of river barges to transport grain on the Danube. Heavy congestion can also be encountered in the port of Constanta where trains bringing in grain are forced to wait for days for goods to be transhipped onto transport vessels.\nUS Embassy: Unity prevails\n“In the face of adversity, unity prevails.

The tunneling works are carried out by Consorzio Telese Scarl under a EUR 470 million contract.\nThe Apice – Hirpinia section would enter services in December 2026, followed by Hirpinia – Orsara expected to provide passenger services from august 2027.\nThe project of Hirpinia – Orsara section covers the construction of 28 km of line, of which 27 km built underground, allowing trains to run at 250 km/h. In 2021, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana awarded a EUR 1 billion contract to the consortium of Webuild (leader, 70%) and Pizzarotti (30%). The project consists of Hirpinia tunnel (27.1 km) and Cervaro Viaduct (314 metres).\nThe 11.8 km Orsara – Bovino project was awarded in 2021 to Webuild – Pizzarotti under a EUR 367.2 million contract and is expected to be opened in December 2026. The project will double the capacity of the existing single-track section, passing for the most part through a tunnel of 10 km in length. The project also comprises a temporary connection of a double-rail line with the historic one for 1.08 kilometres, supporting trains travelling at speeds of up to 90 km/h.\nOn the Naples – Bari high-speed project, Webuild Group is involved in the construction of Apice – Hirpinia, Napoli – Cancello and Hirpinia – Orsara sections.\nSince August 2022, all the construction sites of the new 145 km Naples – Bari railway line have been under construction. Upon completion of the work, the line will reduce travel time by two hours from 4 hours to a 2-hour journey only, whilst the Rome – Bari connection will take 3 hours, as a saving of about two hours compared to now.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(100,'Railway PRO','Northern Trains to acquire 450 trains','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/northern-trains-to-acquire-450-trains/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Northern-Trains-326x245.jpg','August 10, 2023','2023-09-20 16:42:36','British rail operator Northern Trains Limited (NTL) launched a procurement process to renew its train fleet by purchasing 450 trains under a framework contract with a single supplier.

The effort is supported by USD 50 million from the Governor’s Rebuild Illinois capital programme, which is the largest and only one in state history that includes all transport modes.\nGrant applicants include Amtrak, Illinois Department of Transportation, the Chicago Department of Transportation, Cook County, Metra, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the Michigan Department of Transportation, which are contributing a combined USD 218.2 million toward the improvements.\n“The Chicago Hub Improvement Programme is an opportunity for new federal infrastructure funding to catalyze the rail system this region deserves. This proposal would not only make much-needed improvements to Union Station and existing rail lines throughout Illinois and into Michigan — it would unlock a vast system of new and expanded passenger rail services throughout the Midwest, with Chicago’s Union Station serving as the hub,” Governor JB Pritzker said.\nThe federal grant, which would be delivered under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will be used to improve regional rail infrastructure to deliver better passenger services in the Midwest region, comprising 12 states as well as across the U.S.A.\nChicago Hub Improvement Programme comprises three major components which involve the improvement of Chicago Union Station, and the rail infrastructure across Chicago area, as well as the infrastructure between Chicago and Detroit.\nThe projects will expand capacity, eliminate bottlenecks, and improve accessibility and customer experience for more than 30 million passengers annually.\nUnder the plans, the projects at the Chicago Union Station (CUS) will significantly improve passenger experience within the station. During peak periods the station and its components operate at or above capacity, being unable to accommodate increased ridership. The projects to be carried out at the Chicago Union Station aim at modifying and improving platforms, upgrading the concourse, improving ventilation and air quality in the train sheds, and removing obsolete structures to improve safety. Amtrak will activate tracks for passenger use that were first built for the Old Post Office, to increase capacity for Amtrak and Metra service at the station.\nPart of the improvement of infrastructure in Chicago area, the asked federal grant will also provide a new connection between Union Station and the St. Charles Air Line bridge – on the Chicago River – over the south branch, that, combined with adjustments to track configurations and additional track east of the bridge, will reduce travel time by 15 minutes on Illini/Saluki and City of New Orleans train route. The projects to be implemented under the CHIP will also make possible additional service to downstate Illinois and St. Louis, as well as to Michigan and Indiana. These endeavors will also enable the long-held vision of connecting O’Hare\nAirport, through CUS, to McCormick Place.\nThe improvement of the Chicago – Detroit connection covers the rejuvenation of 25.7 km (16 miles) of a second track that Amtrak owns in southwest Michigan to eliminate a bottleneck and help reduce by 30 minutes the trip between Chicago and Detroit.\nIn the past 15 years, ridership in Illinois has doubled, with the introduction this summer of two passenger trains between Chicago and St. Louis running at up to 170 km/h (110mph). Today, more than half of all the country’s long-distance rides begin or end at Union Station. The improvements also are necessary to support expansions to Minneapolis/St. Paul and several destinations to Wisconsin. This will bring benefits to more than 15 intercity routes.\nThe Illinois Governor is investing USD 33.2 billion in the state’s aging transport system including roads and bridges, transit, waterways, aviation, and bicycle and pedestrian accommodations across the state. For rail transport, USD 1 billion is invested of which USD 600 million investment supports passenger services.\n \n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(105,'Railway PRO','Beacon Rail acquires MRCE','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/beacon-rail-acquires-mrce/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MRCE-326x245.jpg','August 9, 2023','2023-09-20 16:43:00','Beacon Rail, a rolling stock leasing company, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mitsui Rail Capital Europe (MRCE), a full-service locomotive leasing business in Europe from Mitsui & Co., Ltd.\nThe transaction is expected to be completed before the end of March 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. Mitsui will record a profit following the completion of the transaction, the majority of which has been reflected in Mitsui’s forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2024 announced in May 2023.\nUnder the transaction, Mitsui & Co., Ltd decided to divest all of the 780,000 shares (100%) in MRCE to Beacon Rail, without disclosing the transfer price, based on an agreement between the parties.\nThe Mitsui Rail Capital Europe has a capital of EUR 78 million and is 100% owned by Mitsui. In FY March, 2022, the value MRCE’s assets was at EUR 640 million and recorded a revenue of EUR 149 million.\nFounded in 2004 and headquartered in the Netherlands, MRCE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui and is one of the leading electric locomotive leasing companies in Europe. The company owns more than 340 state-of-the-art electric locomotives in 18 countries.\nIn August 2022, Mitsui Rail Capital Europe ordered from Siemens Mobility 14 Vectron locomotives that will be added to the existing fleet of 147 Vectron units. The ordered locomotives are planned to be used in nine European countries – Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. The locomotives will be manufactured at the Siemens Mobility plant in Munich-Allach and equipped with the European Train Control System (ETCS) as well as the required national train control systems.\nMRCE provides a full-service offer delivered through a network of 3rd party workshops, which include maintenance, training and logistical support services.\nThe last few years MRCE and Siemens Mobility have collaborated in founding a joint venture, resulting the Locomotive Workshop Rotterdam (LWR) that offers a wide range of services for preventive and corrective maintenance of electrical locomotives. The workshop has been inaugurated in November 2019.

Last year we transported more than 10 million tonnes of goods abroad,” said Tomáš Tóth, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company ČD Cargo.\nThe Czech rail carrier is expanding and is equipping its locomotive fleet with the latest technologies to allow cross-border services.\nAlso last year, ČD Cargo and Siemens Mobility signed a contract to acquire 10 Vectron MS electric locomotives that will gradually be handed over from the second half of 2024. The locomotives will be equipped with ETCS Level 2 Baseline 3 and are approved for operation in the Czech Republic, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.\nIn March 2023, two new 393 Vectron AC locomotives with an auxiliary diesel engine (DPM) have been added to the vehicle fleet of the operator. These locomotives are part of the Siemens X4 modular platform that includes locomotives of various purposes and systems. The locomotives of the 393 series are four-axle interoperable dual-system locomotives capable of running at a speed of up to 200 km/h on 15 kV and 25 kV AC traction systems. The new engines are equipped with an auxiliary diesel engine (DPM – Diesel Power Module) for operation on handling tracks and sidings without traction catenary line or when shunting. The DPM module consists of a 180-kW diesel unit located in the engine room and a fuel tank. These locomotives are primarily used for operation in Austria and Germany by ČD Cargo’s foreign branches.\nIn November 2022, ČD – Telematika retrofitted the on-board unit of the ETCS to the last of a total of 78 locomotives of series 163 and 363 of the carrier ČD Cargo. The entire project was implemented by the supplier association ČD – Telematika and AŽD. This is an important contract as the company owns 78 “promising locomotives ready for the exclusive operation of trains under the supervision of ETCS which will be launched on a larger scale in the Czech Republic beginning 2025,” Tomáš Tóth said at the handing over event.\nFrom 2025, the Czech Republic plans to introduce exclusive operation under the ETCS on selected backbone corridors. The exclusive operation mode means that traction vehicles without ETCS on-board units will no longer be admitted to these lines. The company ČD – Telematika is currently working on retrofitting 30 multi-system electric locomotives.\nTo retrofit its locomotives with the ETCS Level 2 Baseline 3, ČD Cargo obtained a EUR 16.3 million financing under the 2022 CEF Transport call for proposals. This co-financing will ensure retrofitting and fitment of 99 electric locomotives of six different types which will increase interoperability, efficiency and safety of rail traffic.\nThe company also was selected to receive a co-financing of EUR 6.6 million under the 2021 CEF Transport calls for proposals to retrofit and upgrade 122 electric locomotives of five different types with Level 2 Baseline 3.

The process will contribute to designing a new phase of market opening to competition.\nThe questionnaire will collect information on interest in new routes, rolling stock, framework agreements and duration and cooperation between companies, maintenance and commercial services, among other issues. It will also highlight the interest in frequencies, stops, estimated occupancy of services and turnaround time at the terminals. It also asks specifically about the use of the Atocha-Chamartín tunnel with standard gauge rail or the Madrid bypasses, for cross rail services. Through the questionnaire, interested parties will also share the information about the characteristics of the rolling stock and the type of trains (in single or double composition), the number of seats, as well as the maximum speed.\nThe survey also includes questions about the framework agreement model, including the possibility of extending the current ones to other destinations, and its duration, taking into account the initial investment terms. The questionnaire will introduce the opportunity of  cooperation between companies and the use of the code-share system, as in the aviation sector, the priority criteria – in addition to the maximum use of the infrastructure – when it is not possible to coordinate different requests. Maintenance operations, including the possibility of establishing Adif’s own workshops and the needs of a commercial services in the stations, even sharing services with other operators or providing themselves are other issues to establish a comprehensive model of liberalisation.\nThe period to fill up the survey is open until September 15, 2023. The processing of the information provided by the companies in the survey, and in subsequent interviews, deemed by the operators, will be managed with guarantees of confidentiality, Adif says.\nAfter the consolidation of the launch of a single release model, called the ‘Spanish case’, recognised in Europe, Adif wants to continue taking advantage of the capacity of its network, boosting competition, and providing the opportunity to introduce more companies and more railway lines into the rail system, with a new supply of capacity.\nThe first phase of Spanish rail liberalisation opened the market to three operators, which compete with four brands, in the three main high-speed corridors. Some lines that already exceed pre-pandemic traffic levels have increased the modal share compared to other modes of transport and offer more citizens more and more competitive services.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n				\n				Photo credit: © Ricard Duran Agustí\n				\n		\n\nThe Spanish high-speed network, with a total length of 4,000 km, is the widest in Europe and the second in the world after China. The liberalisation of railway services has meant a greater use of a technologically advanced infrastructure, putting value on the investments made in Spain.\nThe first phase of the process of liberalising rail passenger transport in Spain was based on various analyses, both on the interest identified by railway companies in operating country’s rail network, and on the impact of competing rail traffic identified in other European countries. Adif and Adif AV undertook a proactive model, offering capacity to the market and, for the first time in Europe, it has achieved the competition of three operators on the same high-speed corridor.\nThe second phase of liberalisation in Spain will boost competition allowing more operators to enter the market and deliver better services, while rail operators become more responsive to customer needs, improve the quality of their services and their cost-effectiveness.\nThe Spanish rail liberalisation is based on the Fourth Railway Package approved by the European Parliament in December 2016 to reform the system which leads to the improvement of efficiency and competitiveness of the railway transport across Europe, while removing the institutional, legal and technical obstacles.\nThe opening of rail passenger market in Spain started with three selected corridors including Madrid – Barcelona – French Border and Valencia – Barcelona (Corridor 1), Madrid – Levante (Corridor 2 on Valencia and Alicante connection) and Madrid – Toledo – Seville – Malaga (Corridor 3). The framework agreements cover three packages (A, B and C) with different levels of operating capacity for each of the corridors depending on the number of tracks or trains per day and have a duration of ten years.\nIn November 2019, Adif awarded the packages to Rielsfera (Ouigo, a low-cost subsidiary of SCNF), Ilsa comsortium (a partnership created by Air Nostrum [55%] and Treintalia [45%]) and Renfe Viajeros (Renfe Passengers).\nPackage A was exclusively for Renfe Viajeros which under the agreement starts with 96 high-speed trains and will occupy an average of 86% of the capacity offered for this package in all three corridors until 2030, increasing its current offer by 20%.\nUnder package B, Ilsa, operating under the brand Iryo, will run 23 Frecciarossa 1000 trains occupying occupy an average of 70% of the capacity offered for this package in all three corridors. In November 2022, when Iryo started its first services on Madrid – Barcelona corridor, it has become the first high-speed rail transport operator in Spain. In March 2023, Iryo announced the launch of commercial trips between Madrid and Seville with a stop in Córdoba and in Antequera, “breaking the monopoly for the first time in Andalusia.” The inaugural trip has been made between the Madrid-Atocha station and the Seville-Santa Justa station, via Córdoba station. Iryo estimates that in the coming years, it will transport 2.5 million passengers per year in Andalusia, generating tourist spending of EUR 350 million annually. At the national level, the figure will rise to 8 million passengers per year with tourist spending of EUR 2 billion per year. In 2020, Trenitalia signed a EUR 797 million contract with Hitachi Rail and Bombardier Transportation (now Alstom) for the acquisition of 23 Frecciarossa 1000 high-speed trains for services on the three Spanish rail corridors. The trains will have a capacity of 460 passengers and will be able to run at speeds of up to 260 km/h.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe agreement with Ouigo España, an SNCF subsidiary, for the package C included the provision of transport services with trains providing a capacity for more than 500 passengers. The company will operate 14 Euroduplex high-speed trains approved in Spain, with up to 30 daily departures across Spain, occupying 100% of the capacity offered for this package in all the three corridors. In May 2021, Ouigo España launched the transport services on Madrid – Barcelona corridor connecting the two cities in 2h30. Starting October 2022, a journey of 1h50 links Madrid and Valencia and in April 2023, the operator launched two pairs of daily trains connecting Madrid Chamartín and Alicante. The rail company now offers 5 daily return journeys between Madrid and the Valencian community, with 2 for Alicante and 3 for Valencia. The trains connecting Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia run at a speed of 300 km/h.\nOuigo España is the first high-speed train business of SNCF outside France delivering affordable high-speed transport services on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees connecting Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Zaragoza, Tarragona, Alicante and Albacete. The company estimates that in the future, it will offer 25,000 to 30,000 seats a day, with travel times of less than 2h45 to new destinations in Southern Spain such as Córdoba, Seville and Malaga.\nIn the two years since the launch of its first low-cost high-speed rail services, Ouigo España carried more than 5 million passengers. According to SNCF report published in May 2023, Ouigo España carried 509 passengers in each single trainset and up to 1,018 in each duplex, which is the equivalent of 24,600 flights and over 2 million journeys by car.\nIn the process of liberalisation, Adif and Adif AV have made a global proposal for a 60% higher capacity than the one in use with 189 trains per direction per day, compared to 119 in the benchmark set for 2029. The opening of the market would result in a 65% increase of capacity offered with a 50% increase on the Madrid – Barcelona connection, 40% on the Madrid – Levante and 60% on the Madrid – Sur route.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(110,'Railway PRO','Five consortia for Lisbon Red Line extension','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/five-consortia-for-lisbon-red-line-extension/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lisbon-metro-326x245.jpg','August 8, 2023','2023-09-20 16:43:37','Five bidders have submitted their proposals for the design and construction of Lisbon Red Line extension between São Sebastião to Alcântara.

Along the double-track tunnel, it is planned to build three new underground stations (Amoreiras/Campolide, Campo de Ourique and Infante Santo) and Alcântara station that will be built above ground.\nThe tender for this extension has been launched in January 2023 and works are expected to be completed in 2026. The project has a financing of EUR 405.5 million through Portugal’s Recovery and Resilience Plan which is financing two metro projects.\nWhen completed, the line will provide connection between the airport and Alcântara district situated in western Lisbon. The extension is expected to add 11 million new passengers in the first year of its operation, eliminating 3.7 million car trips per year which will translate in a reduction of 6.2 million tonnes of CO2. This section would deliver benefits estimated at EUR 1 billion in three decades.\nLison Red Line extension is part of Metropolitano de Lisboa strategy to expand metro network to improve Lisbon mobility, promoting accessibility and connectivity in public transport, the reduction of travel times and the decarbonisation of transport supported by the increase of city’s public transport.\nMetropolitano de Lisboa plans three expansion projects including the Circular Line, Red Line extension and the modernisation of the signalling systems and the renewal of the train fleet.\nThe Circular Line covers a 1.9 km metro extension with two stations which will connect and Cais do Sodré stations on the Green Line, providing an expanded metro connection with the Yellow Line. EUR 331 million is the value of the project that was approved in November 2018. On February 28, 2023, Metropolitano de Lisboa announced the completion of tunnel excavation that will link the future Estrela and Santos stations. This extension is expected to enter passenger services in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in the first year of operation, will attract 9 million passengers. This extension will remove 3.4 million car trips and will reduce CO2 emissions by 4.1 million tonnes.\nUnder the extension and modernisation project, the metro operator is implementing in parallel the installation of the new CBTC signalling system between Oriente and São Sebastião stations. In 2021, Metropolitano de Lisboa signed a EUR 114.5 million contract with a consortium comprising Stadler and Siemens Mobility for the supply of 14 three-car metro trains and the CBTC system to be installed on the Blue, Green and Yellow lines.\nThe Violet Line is a proposed connection between Quinta de Sao Roque and Hospital Beatriz Ângelo in Loures municipality, 15 km north of Lisbon city centre. EUR 390 million is the value of the project covering the construction of a 13 km line with 19 stations, with three underground stations, expected to be completed in 2025. Metropolitano de Lisboa and the authorities of Loures and Odivelas municipalities signed an agreement in 2021 to start the project that was approved in September 2021. In Loures, the line will be 7.4 km long served by 11 stations in three districts and in Odivelas, the remaining 5.1 km with eight stations will provide transport access in six districts. This light rail line is financed by the Recovery and Resilience Plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026.\nThis expansion of the system will reach parts of Lisbon that do not have metro connection and will provide an extended public transport system and access to heavy-rail network through the Lisboa – Cascais line and river ports linking Lisboa and Montijo, Seixal and Almada.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(111,'Railway PRO','Modernisation completed for Gdańsk central station','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/modernisation-completed-for-gdansk-central-station/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gdansk-Glowny-326x245.jpg','August 7, 2023','2023-09-20 16:43:46','Poland’s Minister of Infrastructure, Andrzej Adamczyk, and the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Infrastructure, Andrzej Bittel, inaugurated the modernised Gdańsk Main railway station which needed a PLN 120 million (EUR 27 million) investment co-financed by the EU through the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment. The renovation and modernisation of the historic station building of the station began in 2019.\n“The completion of the modernisation of Gdańsk Main railway station was expected by many residents and tourists and is an important element of the great modernisation of the Polish railways carried out by our government. That is why I am convinced that the facility that will be made available today will be the pride of the city and its inhabitants,” the Minister of Infrastructure said.\nThe project covered the redecoration of the façade, works to provide increased space in the interior in particular in the station hall where all the glass windows were reconstructed. The station also gained in the functionality of the passenger service area. Station’s most important part is the hall which also serves as a waiting room where air conditioning systems have been installed. Around it, there are ticket offices, PKP Intercity customer service centre and InfoDworzec. There will be several commercial premises right next to the lobby, and more will be located in the arcade, to the left of the main entrance.\nTwo elevators and escalators were installed to provide fast and increased accessibility to the station’s facilities and platforms, and a spacious waiting room fitted with all needed amenities for parents with children was created. From the underground level, a tunnel connects the station building with the existing passages to the platforms and provide passengers access to public transport services, including a tram stop, providing access to the city centre.\nThe station was equipped with a modern passenger information system providing information on train arrivals and departures.\nArchitectural barriers in the station building and its surroundings have also been removed, making it fully accessible to people with disabilities which in addition benefit Braille and tactile signs.\nThe station has also become more environmentally friendly and safer. The heat pumps, air-conditioning units, as well as energy-saving lighting were installed in the building. The systems for partial recovery of rainwater and the used water are saving the consumption which allows for water recycling.\nGdańsk station has also been equipped with an intelligent building management system that optimises the consumption of electricity, heat and water. The modern security systems such as monitoring, access control or a burglary and assault signaling system as well as fire protection systems, ensure passengers safety and security.\nThe reconstruction of the railway station also covered its surroundings. The work consisted mainly in the construction of a new surface area, as well as the driveway infrastructure to the building, where kiss&ride facilities were marked out.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nIn addition to restoring the original colors of the walls, the oak windows of the ticket offices and the original door joinery were restored. The eastern stained glass combines motifs symbolising the power and openness of the city of Gdańsk, while the western one shows the strength of the railway. The side-stained glass windows combine geometric patterns with floral motifs.\nConservation works were an important element of the reconstruction of the station. The original shape of the building was recreated, with sloping roofs with turrets covered with copper sheet over the northern part. The roof of the station is covered with yellow and greenish zigzag ceramic tiles. The 48-meter tower of the station with clocks was renovated, as well as numerous architectural details on the façade, including the coats of arms of Gdańsk above the main entrance held by lions and above the large half-rosette, as well as the coat of arms of Poland on the top of the front façade. The group of coats of arms on the facade from the side of the platforms, as well as two winged axles – railway symbols – on the top of the roof above the main hall have also undergone renovation. The whole effect was emphasised by the new illumination of the station.\nGdańsk Main railway station was built between 1896 and 1900 in the so-called “Gdansk Renaissance” style now providing modern and comfortable space for passenger services.\nThe modernised station is “one of the most important and most difficult investments made under the Railway Station Investment Programme. Thanks to this modernisation, the inhabitants of Gdańsk have gained a railway station, which will certainly be one of the city’s landmarks. I hope that the modern and environmentally friendly building will make it easier for passengers and tourists to travel by rail to the Polish seaside.\nUnder the Railway Station Investment Programme, Poland will invest PLN 3 billion (EUR 674.7 million) to modernise nearly 200 rail stations across the country such as Gdańsk Wrzeszcz, Pruszcz Gdański and Żelistrzewo railway stations.\nPhotos: Dominik Paszliński | Gdańsk City Hall\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(112,'Railway PRO','JICA to develop a rail masterplan for Metro Manila','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/jica-to-develop-a-rail-masterplan-for-metro-manila/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Philippines-DOTr-326x245.jpg','August 7, 2023','2023-09-20 16:43:50','Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines signed an agreement on technical cooperation to develop Greater Manila railway masterplan for the next 30 years.\nThe agreement was signed by the Philippines’ Transport Secretary Jaime J.

The locomotives are reliable but do not live up to the environmental requirements of the future, while new diesel locomotives with a 30-40 year depreciation period are risky to invest in given the uncertainty surrounding future emission requirements.\nWith the acquisition of these diesel AM843 locomotives, which also received environmental updates during their lifetime, Nordic Re-Finance ensures that future-proof diesel locomotives will be available on the Swedish market.\n“The purchase of the locomotives responds to the need we see that the market is asking for, to also carry out the deal together with SBB Cargo, where we have established a good cooperation through previous vehicle purchases, feels safe and stable,” working chairman of the board of Nordic Re-Finance Sven Engquist said.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(118,'Railway PRO','Toronto Maintenance Centre modernisation begins','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/toronto-maintenance-centre-modernisation-begins/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Toronto-Maintenance-Centre-new-326x245.jpg','August 4, 2023','2023-09-20 16:44:16','VIA Rail has started the major upgrade and construction works for its Toronto Maintenance Centre that will provide a state-of-the-art maintenance facility for the new fleet of 32 trains.\nThe works will be conducted by Buttcon Limited, a construction from Woodbridge, Ontario and will create up to 475 local jobs in the trade and construction industries between now and completion in 2026.\nThe scope of the work includes the demolition of a portion of the existing structure and the construction of state-of-the-art facilities, the construction of a new addition, removal, and replacement of tracks, and the addition of a stand-alone wheel lathe facility (to maintain wheels and ensure smooth operation on the tracks) and critical infrastructure improvements throughout the maintenance yard.\nThe facility is an important pillar in VIA Rail’s large-scale modernisation which aims to transform the way Canadians travel from reservation to destination and it will service the trains that will be used for the rail corridor between Québec and City-Windsor.\n“This modernised maintenance centre will support us in our mission to provide our passengers the most enjoyable travel experience and better connect Canadian communities. It will also allow our employees to work with the most modern equipment and will provide them the necessary tools to maintain the new fleet according to VIA Rail’s standards of excellence,” Mario Péloquin, VIA Rail’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe modernisation of VIA Rail’s Toronto Maintenance Centre protects the investment in the new fleet by increasing its longevity.

Financing for the trains is guaranteed by the State of Bavaria through a leasing model. The first trains are scheduled to enter passenger service at the end of 2028.\nFor the first time in Germany, completely integrated S-Bahn trains with a total length of more than 200 meters will be in use, providing capacity for 1,841 passengers. The new S-Bahn trains ordered for Munich offer more space, greater comfort, and many innovations. With the order, the State of Bavaria and the Munich S-Bahn are preparing for expected passenger growth in coming decades and for the planned mobility transition. The trains are highly energy-efficient, require little maintenance, and receive software updates via the cloud.\n“We are heralding a new era and taking the Munich S-Bahn into the future. As the person responsible for regional rail transport in Bavaria, I can say that this investment is well worth the price. After all, no less than two-thirds of all local rail passengers in Bavaria will benefit from the trains, and virtually all local transport in the Munich region more or less depends on a well-functioning and attractive S-Bahn,” Bavarian Transport Minister Christian Bernreiter said.\nIn the new trains, the interior LED lighting varies depending on the time of day. Classic three- and four-seat arrangements offer more legroom than the trains currently in service. The cars also have group areas and folding seats. Greater passenger comfort and convenience is provided by free Wi-Fi, improved mobile phone reception with special windows, USB and power sockets, and generous storage racks. A far more powerful air conditioning system operating with environmentally friendly refrigerants ensures pleasant interior temperatures even in extreme heat of up to 45 degrees Celsius.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe S-Bahn XXL trains are equipped with a completely new passenger information system. The displays are located above the doors both inside and outside the car, on the ceiling, and in the transitions between the cars. The displays track the course of the journey and provide information about the stations and the occupancy of the respective train. Before passengers exit, the displays indicate where the closest stairs or elevators are located on the platform. Outside the train, LED strips show the color of the respective S-Bahn line.\nWide doors and spacious entry areas ensure easy and quick boarding and exiting and ease the optimal distribution of passengers throughout the train. Depending on the train’s occupancy, the folding seats can be automatically locked in place to provide additional standing room. Five of the 13 cars have large multi-purpose zones, accessed through three doors, that provide sufficient room for bicycles, strollers, luggage, or walkers. Special areas at each end of the train provide space for wheelchairs. To better understand announcements made on the train, passengers with hearing aids can connect to the information system via Bluetooth.\nThe new trains are more innovative, more digitalised, and more networked than ever before in order to minimise lifecycle costs through maximum energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and optimized operational support.\nThe S-Bahn trains are designed with a large number of redundant components and are equipped with the Railigent X system that guarantees maximum train availability. Railigent X is part of the open, digital Siemens Xcelerator business platform, which enables customers to achieve a simpler, faster, and readily scalable digital transformation. Moreover, software updates for the trains no longer have to be manually installed in the depot, which is time-consuming, but are transmitted to the trains via a secure online connection as part of the maintenance.\nThe new S-Bahn trains will be equipped with ETCS, an ATO system, and a Train Integrity Monitoring System (TIMS). Thanks to their integration of ATO over ETCS, the new S-Bahn trains will be fit for rail transport of the future.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(120,'Railway PRO','Agreement signed to transform Greater Manchester stations','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/agreement-signed-to-transform-greater-manchester-stations/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NR-TfGM-326x245.jpg','August 3, 2023','2023-09-20 16:44:26','Network Rail and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) signed a partnership to deliver a joint vision for Greater Manchester stations initially focusing on Manchester and Salford central railway stations.\nOver the next 12 months the two organisations will work with key stakeholders and future partners on proposals across six stations including Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Victoria, Manchester Oxford Road, Deansgate, Salford Central and Salford Crescent.\nThe collaboration agreement, the first of its kind between the two organisations, is a major step forward in bringing together both land and infrastructure to create a better-connected Greater Manchester.\nNetwork Rail and TfGM, working together with key stakeholders, will establish future regeneration opportunities at Greater Manchester stations and attract partners for delivery of future projects.\nManchester is the fastest growing metropolitan area in the UK. The total population of Greater Manchester is predicted to grow to around 2,950,000 by 2031, with the City of Manchester alone accounting for 36% of the growth.\nNetwork Rail owns over 90 stations in Greater Manchester and more than 5.6 million journeys are made across TfGM’s transport network each day. The partnership will focus on transport upgrades and supporting regeneration that allow the two cities to meet the demands of future population growth and further support the regional economy.\nThrough the new Trailblazer Deal struck with government, there is a huge opportunity for Greater Manchester to deliver the Bee Network, its vision for a fully integrated public transport system, with ambition for full integration of local rail services by 2030. This partnership will play a part in helping with its future delivery.\nAs city centres are changing in a post-Covid landscape, rail stations provide significant opportunities for growth and regeneration by improving space to better connect them with the people and places they are designed to serve.\nThe two organisations, alongside future partners and supporters are committed to deliver passenger and communities an integrated transport system to attract customers and provide a service which encourages people to use public transport first and reduce reliance on cars.\nAll parties involved will contribute to the development of the areas around the stations securing additional funding and maximising commercial development opportunities which will increase the attractiveness of development opportunities by looking at them in a comprehensive way.

The Polish rail operator made the terms of the future order more flexible and increased the amount allocated for the project.\nIn 2021, PKP Intercity announced a competitive dialogue procedure, and in 2022 it invited contractors to submit tenders. At the beginning of this year, one offer was submitted, the value of which was over PLN 7.8 billion (EUR 1.75 billion), which significantly exceeded the assumed budget by PLN 2.4 billion (EUR 539.5 million). Therefore, PKP Intercity announces a new procedure, but some elements related to the requirements and execution of the order are changed. They have been modified keeping in mind the manufacturers’ potential and their ability to submit an offer and carry out the project.\nThe new procedure is conducted in the form of an open tender, and not as before in the form of a competitive dialogue.PKP Intercity decided to make the delivery date of all vehicles more flexible.Previously, the operator required that the entire project be completed no later than May 31, 2026.Now the expected time is a maximum of 54 months (4.5 years) from the date of conclusion of the contract.\nPKP Intercity has also changed the rules of payment for the execution of the order. In the previous proceedings, a 5% advance payment was included, while now, in addition to the 5% advance payment, the rail operator assumes additional partial payments:\n\nafter manufacturing the body of each vehicle and performing partial acceptance with a positive result – 15% of the value of the unit price of a given vehicle;\nafter successful factory acceptance of each vehicle – 15% of the value of the unit price of a given vehicle;\nafter successful final acceptance of each vehicle – 65% of the value of the unit price of a given vehicle.\n\nPKP Intercity also proposes a different approach to the issue of valorisation. The previous procedure included bilateral indexation for the provision of maintenance services with a cap of up to 2.06% and no more than 15% in relation to the prices from the offer. In the current tender, a bilateral valorisation without a cap was assumed, of course, provided that the circumstances specified in detail in the contract occur.\nIn 2020, the rail operator has started the preparation for the launch of this rolling stock tender by conducting a technical dialogue with potential vehicle manufacturers. Thanks to this, it was possible to create a description of the needs and requirements necessary to initiate the procedure aimed at selecting the contractor and concluding the contract.\nThe project for the delivery of 38 push-pull trains and 45 locomotives is included in the list of projects implemented under the National Recovery Plan (NRP).\nHowever, it assumes the implementation of the entire project by the end of 2026. Due to the specification of a new deadline for the delivery of vehicles up to 54 months from the date of signing the contract, it is not possible to maintain the indicated deadline. In order to responsibly use the funds from the National Recovery Plan, the company, together with the Ministry of Infrastructure, applied to the European Commission to transfer them to other rolling stock projects. The purchase of push-pull vehicles together with locomotives will be financed from other funds provided for in the development strategy, such as the external financing, own funds or funds from the issue of bonds.\nSpecifications for the rolling stock tender \nThe order includes 38 control cars, 228 middle cars and 45 multi-system electric locomotives.\nThe locomotives will be adapted to operate in push-pull mode. This means that they can both push and pull trains, which reduces the need for shunting work when the train is going in the opposite direction. In addition, the vehicles covered by the order, after obtaining additional approval, will also be able to travel on the railway network in the Czech Republic. The electric locomotives will also be able to drive trains of classic coaches, which will increase the operational flexibility of the carrier.\nThe double-decker trains will be a novelty in the PKP Intercity fleet. They will allow efficient service for passengers traveling between the largest Polish agglomerations. The new trains will have a capacity of up to 700 passengers, which will be offered more comfort and amenities.\nThe technical capabilities of the vehicles will be adapted to the modernised railway lines, equipped with the ETCS, which will allow for travel at speeds of up to 200 km/h.\nThe double-decker train will have seven carriages, which will provide plenty of seating. The configuration of the trainset also allows flexible adaptation of the vehicle to the demand on each route and enables the operation of the trainsets in push-pull mode in various variants from 2 to 10 middle cars. The steering car will have first-class seats and a quiet zone, while the middle universal cars will provide second-class seats, a quiet zone and space for transporting bicycles or skis. The middle cars will offer second-class seats, including for families with children, space for vending machines and a conductor’s compartment.\nThe trains will have a completely new design and will also be equipped with a number of amenities that are becoming standard in the carrier’s trains.Passengers will use air-conditioned carriages with 230V and USB sockets.Wi-Fi access will also be provided.In the interests of passenger safety, a monitoring system and defibrillators will be used in the carriages.The vehicles will be adapted to the needs of wheelchair users and families with children.\nThe coaches will also be able to be used in classic trains, then only in the pull function, like the other carriages of the operator. The selected contractor will be responsible for the provision of technical maintenance services for the locomotives for the period indicated in the offer, but not less than 60 months.\nBy 2030, PKP Intercity plans to run about twice as many trains, increase the number of passengers to almost 90 million annually and offer travellers a high standard of travel. In order to achieve this, the company has adopted the strategy to invest in new rolling stock and renew the existing trains and locomotives for which a PLN 27 billion (ERU 6 billion) budget has been allocated.\nOne of the key elements of the strategy is this rolling stock tender that will provide fast and rapid services as well as an increased capacity as the new vehicles will be able to carry up to 700 passengers at a time. PKP Intercity says that “it is particularly important that the project to purchase this type of rolling stock is implemented and that the vehicles are delivered in the coming years.”\nRecently, the Polish rail operator has ordered from Newag 5 additional multi-system electric locomotives bringing the entire number of vehicles to 15 vehicles under the framework agreement signed in 2021. PLN 388 million (EUR 87.4 million) is the value of this entire order.\nIn addition, in March, PKP Intercity signed another contract with Newag for the purchase of 20 Griffin electric locomotives worth PLN 551.4 million (EUR 117.2 million). They will be delivered in February 2024 and will be able of running at 160 km/h on the rail routes connecting the major Polish cities.\nAccording to the company’s rolling stock procurement schedule, this year the company expects to sign the framework agreement for the supply of 300 new coaches with an option for 150 additional vehicles. The tender was launched in November 2022 and includes the delivery of railcars in seven design configurations.\nIn 2022, PKP Intercity transported 59 million passengers, a record increase from 49 million (in 2019). When releasing the statistics, the operator said that this historic figure is due to the rolling stock investment programme which provides passengers with modern, comfortable and faster services.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(122,'Railway PRO','Shortlisted unveiled for Rail Baltica CCS system','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/shortlisted-unveiled-for-rail-baltica-ccs-system/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rail-Baltica-326x245.png','August 3, 2023','2023-09-20 16:44:37','All the five consortia that submitted applications for the Rail Baltica singalling and command-control tender have been qualified to enter the tender procedure.\nThe selected candidates are:\n\nGTS Deutschland GmbH (Germany);\nHitachi Rail (Italy);\nIndra Sistemas – AŽD Praha association (Spain, Czech republic);\nSKGN Baltics association – comprising Siemens Mobility Latvia Branch, Siemens Mobility GmbH, GRK Suomi, NRC Group Finland, Kontron Transportation GmbH (Latvia, Germany, Finland, Austria);\nAlstom – Cobra – Fima partnership comprising Alstom Transport, Alstom Baltics, Cobra Instalaciones y Servicios, Fima – Kza Krakow (France, Latvia, Spain).\n\nThe contract with the chosen partner is planned to be signed by the end of 2024.\n“The implementation of this state-of-the-art system involves advanced technologies and modern signalling solutions, designed to meet the demands of high-speed train operations.

This includes approximately 30 km in New South Wales and 9km in Queensland.\nWhile the approvals for the New South Wales section of the project are now complete, the 9 km section of rail in Queensland is still being considered by the Queensland State Government’s Office of the Coordinator General as part of the separate Border to Gowrie EIS process.\nActivities to secure the land required for the North Star to New South Wales/Queensland Border corridor and inform the design of the project are continuing, including land and geotechnical surveys.\nFuture construction north of Narromine will only proceed once all necessary approvals have been gained, to provide sufficient certainty that the Inland Rail project can be built to an agreed budget and timeframe.\nThe Inland Rail North Star-Queensland Border section will cross along the route between Bibilah, Mungle and Wearne, which will need track upgrade, and from Toomelah towards Queensland, the infrastructure must be constructed. The line follows the existing track north from North Star before crossing Bruxner Way and the border to join the existing Queensland Rail line.\nThe project is currently in the reference design stage. During this time, ARTC are conducting various studies and consulting with landowners and other key stakeholders to better understand potential issues and opportunities around the Macintyre River crossing.\nAccording to the schedule of the project, the detailed design, early works and constructions are planned to be completed in 2026 and commissioning and operation would be possible from 2027.\nInland Rail is a 1,700km freight corridor which will be the backbone of Australia’s freight transport providing transit times of less than 24 hours for freight trains travelling between Melbourne and Brisbane via regional Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

Caroline is constructing the “upline”, where trains will travel to the Midlands and North.\nIn total, the twin-bored Northolt Tunnel will have a length of 8.4 miles (13.5 km) and is expected to be complete by 2025.\nOver 240,000 m3 of mixed soil – London Clay, chalk and sand – has been extracted during the tunnelling process so far and is being used north of the tunnel to create new wildlife habitat and landscaping. The earth is kept within the HS2 site boundaries.\n“Work to build the HS2 network in London is gaining momentum and completing one mile of twin bored tunnel is another sign of progress on delivering the HS2 route between London and Birmingham,” Rail Minister Huw Merriman said.\nA team of 17 tunnel engineers from Skanska Costain Strabag joint venture (SCS JV) has been operating these two TBMs of HS2, working closely with a 60 strong team on the ground.\n“Completing our first mile of tunnelling on both of our TBMs is a fantastic moment for the HS2 London tunnels programme. Early next year our next two TBMs will be launched from Victoria Road crossover box, close to Old Oak Common station. All these drives will then meet at Greenpark Way in Greenford, forming the route for the initial opening of HS2 into London,” James Richardson, Managing Director of SCS JV said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe 58,000 tunnel segments for this section of the London tunnels are being manufactured by Pacadar on the Isle of Grain in Kent. Recently the delivery of the segments has been by rail to the sidings at the West Ruislip site, reducing lorry journeys on roads.\nThe SCS JV team are now preparing to begin the construction of cross passages between the two tunnels. The link between the two parallel tunnels will be used in emergencies.\nThe TBMs are due to reach the first ventilation and emergency access shaft at South Ruislip in Autumn 2023, after they have travelled a distance 1.7 miles (2.7 km). The shaft is 35 metres deep and a ‘headhouse’ will be built above it to house safety equipment. The building will have a green roof and will be constructed using timber and brick, sympathetic to the local landscape.\nThe Northolt Tunnel will be completed with two additional TBMs which will be launched from the opposite end of the tunnel at Victoria Road Crossover Box in Ealing next winter. All four TBMs constructing the tunnel will end their journeys at Greenpark Way in Greenford in Ealing where they will be extracted from the ground.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(130,'Railway PRO','Singapore introduces new trains on NEL','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/singapore-introduces-new-trains-on-nel/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LTA-NEL-trains-326x245.jpg','August 1, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:12','Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) has started the progressive deploying of six new trains for North East Line (NEL) which will be added to the existing fleet.\nAll six new trains are equipped with condition monitoring systems. By collecting data from on-board equipment, these systems allow pre-emptive maintenance measures to be taken before faults occur, thereby enhancing service reliability. They also enable more efficient maintenance.\nTwo of the new trains are fitted with an Automatic Track Inspection (ATI) system, the first one for the North East Line. Cameras and sensors are installed on the underframe of these trains to monitor track conditions while the trains are in operation. This will improve detection of track defects, such as rail cracks, rail corrugation and missing rail fasteners. The ATI system complements existing physical track inspections and enables more timely maintenance of tracks.\nManufactured and assembled by Alstom in Barcelona, Spain, the six new trains arrived in Singapore in April 2021.\nThey have undergone comprehensive testing by LTA, SBST and Alstom, and will be put into passenger service once testing is complete.\nAlongside the launch of new trains, the mid-life upgrade of the 25 first-generation NEL trains is progressing smoothly. The trains will receive enhancements such as newly renovated interiors, new condition-monitoring capabilities, and new air-conditioning and ventilation systems. Four trains have been upgraded so far, and the remaining trains will be progressively upgraded by 2026.\nAdding these trains for North East Line determine the expansion of the fleet from 43 to 49 trainsets.\nIn June LTA and Alstom unveiled the first 16 of the 106 new trains for the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) with progressively entering into operation from June. These new trains, purchased from Alstom SA will replace the NSEWL’s earliest generations of six-car trains, with the oldest having served for over 30 years.\nCurrently, LTA is expanding the North East Line with a 1.6 km new section from the existing Punggol station to the new Punggol Coast station that will be integrated with JTC’s business park in the Punggol Digital District. It will also bring rail connectivity closer to the area and support plans to develop the district into an attractive live-work-learn-play destination for residents, workers and students. Punggol Coast station will bring the total number of stations on the NEL to 17. It will enhance connectivity from Punggol North to the city centre as well as other parts of Singapore, cutting down travel time by up to 15 minutes.  LTA has put in place several measures to minimise construction impact to the public. Instrumentation, real-time monitoring and rigorous survey checks are put in place to ensure the safety of the surrounding infrastructure. Works to construct the tunnels began in 2017, and the station is on track to be completed by 2023.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(131,'Railway PRO','Amtrak continues accessibility projects','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/amtrak-continues-accessibility-projects/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Amtrak-passengers--326x245.jpg','August 1, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:19','Amtrak has invested USD 770 million since 2011 to implement its accessibility projects across the U.S. to ensure a safe, efficient, and comfortable travel experience for customers with disabilities.\nMore accessibility improvements projects are underway on existing and new fleets as well as on how customers book tickets and navigate digital channels.\n“These investments benefit all of our customers by improving the travel experience at every aspect of the journey from trip planning, to purchasing tickets, to using our stations, trains and services,” Amtrak President Roger Harris said.\nAt stations, Amtrak is advancing projects which include the adaption to compliance regarding parking, station building and platforms through a comprehensive multi-year, multi-billion dollar design and construction program providing an accessible and compliant passenger experience. To date we have brought 117 stations into compliance and another 67 stations have been made accessible. The operator is also designing and deploying assistive boarding equipment, including bridge plates, to help customers with reduced mobility board and depart from the train. Another project Amtrak is implementing covers the introduction of new technologies at stations including displaying audio and visual train status and boarding information through passenger information display systems at stations.\nAmtrak is also investing in its fleet. The new Acela and Amtrak Airo trains will offer a public address customer information system to provide real-time information such as train location, train speed, and conductor announcements in audio and visual formats. These new trains will feature spacious and accessible restrooms, vestibules, and Café Cars with integrated boarding equipment for customers with reduced mobility. Accessibility improvements across all fleets include adding handrails to Superliner accessible bedrooms, stair handrails, folding tray tables at accessible seating areas, slip-resistant vestibule flooring, and compliant service counters in Café Cars.\nThe Amtrak Americans with Disabilities Act Stations Program oversees accessibility-related station improvement projects to ensure customers with disabilities can successfully navigate the rail network. The programme has identified another 39 stations for completion this fiscal year at a forecasted investment of USD 140 million.\n“As author of the All Stations Accessibility programme (ASAP) Act, a historic bill that was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I’m proud that Amtrak is showing its commitment to making passenger rail accessible for everyone, all while creating jobs and bringing investment to Illinois,” U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth said.\nWith USD 1.2 billion in investments from the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA), Amtrak will continue advancing a comprehensive improvement program to ensure a safe, efficient and comfortable travel experience with a focus on accessibility and inclusion.\nThe accessibility projects include repairs and upgrades to platforms, ramps and sidewalks, renovations to entranceways and restrooms, and Amtrak is working toward 100% completion by 2029.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(132,'Railway PRO','CPK a step closer to the introduction of 25 kV AC traction system in Poland','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/cpk-a-step-closer-to-the-introduction-of-25-kv-ac-traction-system-in-poland/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cpk-art-326x245.png','August 1, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:23','The power industry has for years been discussing the implementation of 2×25 kV AC power for railway lines in Poland. However, it was not until the CPK investments that this process has actually got off the ground. Following the positive results of the simulation, the company has already submitted applications to connect the traction substations to the power system.\n \nThere has been no slowing down in terms of the 2×25 kV AC power supply for the railway lines being built by Centralny Port Komunikacyjny. As a result of the agreement signed in mid-November last year with a design contractor, technical concepts have already been developed for all the substations that are to supply power for the Y-shaped highspeed railway line on the Warsaw – Łódź and Łódź – Wrocław sections.\nThat is a total of five facilities fed by the 400 kV and 220 kV networks.\nThe traction simulations have also taken place, showing exactly what power demand the trains running should generate and how much energy they will consume. This has allowed, as the next step, the verification that the substations would not have a negative impact on the national power system.\n\nThe Y-shaped line Warsaw – CPK – Łódź Wrocław/Poznań\n \nApplications submitted, verification started. What next?\n Having ensured that all the parameters (including the key voltage unbalance) were normal, CPK submitted applications for the five facilities with Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne (PSE). Similar work is currently underway for facilities on the Poznań branch of the Y-shaped line, Sieradz-Poznan and on the other lines of the CPK high speed railway system.\nThe transmission system operator now has five months to review the applications, including drawing up its own expert opinion. This should be followed by the issuing of the connection requirements and then the conclusion of the utility connection agreement.\n“This is going to open the next chapter of the partnership between CPK and PSE, namely the construction stage. The construction of the substations is going to be carried out by CPK, while the construction or expansion of the Grid Supply Point substations, which are at the tie-in point, is the task of the transmission operator,” explains Mateusz Malinowski, head of railway power supply projects at CPK.\nThe task is very ambitious because at the same time PSE is implementing its own, very extensive Transmission Network Development Plan (TNDP) for 2023-2032. It adapts the Polish network to the changes in the generation sector so that it can cope with the transmission of energy from, for example, offshore wind farms and nuclear power plant, as well as increasing the share of renewable energy sources (RES) at the expense of conventional ones.\nThe TNDP document is, without exaggeration, a “plan for the second electrification of Poland”. In November 2022, the TNDP also included works related to the connection of the CPK traction substations, and in April 2023, a new Regulation on the conditions of operation of the electricity system was issued, which – thanks to the joint work between PSE, CPK and the Ministry of Climate and Environment – included the provisions necessary for the operation of the 2×25 kV system substations.\n“There is no denying that CPK’s activities have allowed the industry to move from years of theoretical discussions on the 2×25 kV system to its practical implementation,” added Mateusz Malinowski .\nAs he pointed out, this year’s reactivation of the scientific and technical conference ‘Modern Electric Traction’ under the aegis of the Polish Association of Transport Engineers and Technicians and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology has become its symbolic confirmation. A large part of the speeches given there discussed the technical aspects of the 2×25 kV system, which relate to the CPK’s actual intentions and are the result of analyses and solutions implemented as part of the design work commissioned by the company.\nMoreover, the positive results of the design, legislative and other arrangements carried out by CPK for the 2×25 kV power supply on new railway lines have revived the debate about converting existing Polish railway lines, powered so far with 3 kV DC, to the new system.\n\n\n \nPower supply system already known in Spain, France and the USA\n \nThe planned 2x25kV traction system, although not yet used in Poland, has been quite popular for many years.\nThe system is used on railway lines in Italy (High Speed Rail), in the UK (on most of the West Coast Main Line and Crossrail), in France (e.g. TGV), in Spain (most of the HSR lines), in the USA (Amtrak), as well as in Finland and Hungary. Currently, the Rail Baltica lines connecting Poland with the Baltic countries, north of the Polish- Lithuanian border, are also being designed with this system in mind.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(133,'Railway PRO','EUR 37 billion rail vision in Island Ireland','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/eur-37-billion-rail-vision-in-island-ireland/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Irish-Rail-326x245.jpg','August 1, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:27','The Department of Transport of Ireland and the Department for Infrastructure of Northern Ireland published for consultation the final version of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review which recommends electrification, new and enhanced routes, greater regional balance and improved speeds and frequency.\nThe strategy is setting out 30 recommendations for developing a rail network that would significantly benefit commuters, communities, businesses, the environment and economies, both north and south. If the recommendations are implemented in full it could transform the rail system in the coming decades with electrification, faster speeds and greatly improved frequency, opening a number of new routes particularly across the West and North of the island, and widening accessibility and connectivity across the island.\nThe All-Island Strategic Rail Review provides six general recommendations which includes the decarbonization of the rail network and rolling stock, the upgrade of the core intercity railway network as well as the construction of the double and fourth tracks – where is needed – to increase intercity service frequencies and capacity. The vision also proposes new regional connections which would see trains operating at speeds of at least 120 km/h, the introduction of sustainable cities concept by delivering more rail services, the transformation of the freight sector by strengthening the rail connectivity to the island’s busiest ports and reduce track access charges for freight. The vision is also focusing on prioritising customers by improving service quality, providing on-board catering, ‘clock-face’ timetable, better integration with other transport options, and cross-border structures to streamline travel north and south.\nThe Department of Transport says that if the review’s recommendations are implemented in full across the coming decades, the capital cost is estimated to be at EUR 36.8 billion in 2023 prices. Of this, the estimated capital cost that would apply to Ireland would total approximately EUR 27.6 billion. If this investment was split evenly across 25 years in 2023 prices, then it would amount to annual capital investment in the rail system of EUR 1 billion per annum over and above existing plans.\nSimilarly, for Northern Ireland the total capital cost estimate in 2023 prices is EUR 9.2 billion, which is approximately EUR 370 million per year over a 25-year period.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(134,'Railway PRO','Avanti begins bi-mode train trials in North Wales','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/avanti-begins-bi-mode-train-trials-in-north-wales/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Avanti-bi-mode-train-326x245.jpg','August 1, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:32','Avanti West Coast has started the test running of the new Class 805 bi-mode trains on the route to Chester and North Wales.

The volume sold in rail passenger transport in Germany saw even higher growth than passenger numbers in comparison with the first six months of 2022 – which translates into more kilometers traveled by passengers in climate-friendly rail transport.\nMore than 808 million passengers took regional trains in Germany in the first half of 2023, around 11.5% more than in the first six months of 2022. More than 68 million passengers took DB’s long distance trains in the same period, which was an increase of 9 million, or 15.4%.\nDB started the selling of Germany Ticket this spring allowing passengers to use it for unlimited public transport services across Germany at EUR 49 per month. The ticket has been used since May 1st on local and regional rail networks.\nThe increase is evident especially in volume sold, which also takes the length of journeys into account and is measured in passenger kilometers. At roughly 21.7 billion passenger kilometers, DB Long-Distance far exceeded performance in the first half of 2022 (18.3 billion passenger kilometers) and surpassed the previous half-year record, which it set in 2019. DB Long-Distance improved its operating profit in the first six months of 2023 by more than EUR 130 million.\nDespite the difficult framework, with ongoing inflation and falling freight rates on international freight markets, DB Group as a whole again generated an operating profit (adjusted EBIT) which totalled EUR 331 million in the first half of 2023.\nDB’s rail freight business unit, DB Cargo, continued to make losses. Negative effects included the deteriorated competitive environment for rail freight transport, much higher electricity prices compared with fuel prices, and a less dynamic market. On the whole, the Integrated Rail System (rail operations in Europe) posted an operating loss of EUR 339 million in the first six months of 2023. Much higher expenses at DB Netze Track for infrastructure improvements were the biggest factor.\nIn addition to the general increase in costs and DB’s much higher expenses for the rail network, changes in the group’s operating profit compared with the first half of 2022 were largely due to industry-wide normalisation of freight rates in air and ocean freight. As expected, this global development affected DB’s logistics subsidiary, DB Schenker. “Even though freight rates in air and ocean freight are normalizing, DB Schenker generated a significant operating profit of EUR 626 million in the first half of the year,” Lutz said.\nThe logistics subsidiary’s positive contribution to DB Group’s bottom line was nearly three times higher than before the pandemic. In 2022, DB Schenker generated the largest profit in its history, due in part to freight charges, which were extremely high throughout the world at that time.\nOperating profit was over EUR 500 million (around 62%) lower than in the first six months of 2022, due in part to DB’s higher expenses up front for improvements to the infrastructure. DB Group’s adjusted revenues totaled roughly EUR 25 billion in the first half of 2023, compared with roughly EUR 28 billion in the same period of 2022.\n“We aren’t even close to tapping the full potential for demand. That is good news for DB and for the climate. The support for rail shows us that continuing to invest in more climate-friendly rail transport is crucial, even in challenging times. At the same time, we are committed to increasing our profitability,” Richard Lutz, Chairman of the Management Board and CEO, said.\nVolume produced in the rail network remained very high in the first half of 2023, at some 558 million train-path kilometers. It was down slightly, by 0.9%, compared with the first half of 2022.\nConstruction and modernisation efforts are at record levels throughout Germany, which caused punctuality in long distance rail transport to fall to 68.7% in the first half of 2023 (down from 69.6% in the first half of 2022). “Although we are asking a lot of all stakeholders at the moment, the infrastructure is the key to sustainable improvements for our customers,” Lutz said.\nDB increased its net capital expenditures from its own funds by 13.1% to EUR 3.1 billion in the first six months of 2023, the most ever invested in the first half of a year.

SNCF had a turnover of EUR 20.7 billion during the period, up 2.2% on the same period last year.\n“The French have chosen the train and it’s good news,” said Jean-Pierre Farandou, chairman of the rail group, quoted in a statement from the French state-owned company.\nAfter 2022, when it achieved record turnover, SNCF followed this rising train in the first half of 2023. SNCF Voyageurs, the operator of passenger trains, had a turnover up 11.3% to EUR 9.3 billion. The success of long-distance travel was due to high-speed trains (TGV), the company’s traditional “locomotive”, despite rising electricity prices.\nTurnover from the TGV business rose 21% in the first quarter. Passenger numbers on TGV and Intercity trains increased by 10%.\nSNCF indicated that the increase in its turnover in the first half of the year was due to a better occupancy rate on trains, 80% in the case of TGV, up 5 percentage points on the previous period, and to the maintenance of the level of fares.\nSNCF first-half results: strikes cost EUR 500 million\nKeolis, the group’s public transport subsidiary, which recently won the contract to operate metro lines 16 and 17 of the Grand Paris Express, also had a successful half-year. Its turnover rose by 7.3% to EUR 3.5 billion.\nWithout the industrial action, SNCF’s net result would have been even better. In the first half of the year, this indicator amounted to EUR 158 million, down on the same period last year when it was EUR 928 million.\nAccording to SNCF, the 14 days of cross-industry strike action and the stoppage of work from 7 March by all the group’s unions cut EUR 400 million from the half-year result. In total, the strikes have cost the company around EUR 500 million, SNCF management said.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(139,'Railway PRO','New public transport app launched in Genoa','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/new-public-transport-app-launched-in-genoa/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Genoa-Hitachi-public-transport-app-326x245.jpg','July 31, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:55','Hitachi Rail’s world-first 360Pass app, connecting Genoa’s entire public transport infrastructure, has been launched and is now available to all 600,000 citizens and the 3,500,000 annual visitors, following a new agreement with the city’s transit authority, AMT.\nHaving completed a successful year long trial, the 360Pass app, known as GoGoGe in Genoa, will transform multi-modal transport across the city. The service offers every person living or visiting Genoa the possibility to plan, book, and pay the cheapest fare for multimodal trips by integrating the city’s public and private transport system. The new app is completely free to download.\nThe GoGoGe app is the result of a partnership between Hitachi Rail, AMT and the Municipality of Genoa, aimed at encouraging the use of public transport and the hiring of electric vehicles by also offering solutions to meet the last-mile needs of Genoa’s many passengers.\nThe service offers users the possibility to plan, book, and pay for multimodal trips by integrating the city’s public and private transport system. In total, 663 buses, 2500 bus stops, the metro line used by 15 million passengers per year, two funiculars, one historic hillside railway, 10 public lifts and two suburban bus routes that span 50 km, have been connected. App users also have the power, via the touch of a button on their mobile phones, to hire an electric car, pay for parking or find an e-moped.\nThe app will automatically detect when the cost of the user’s travel across the city’s bus, tram and metro services has reached that of a weekly travel card: EUR 17,50. At that point, it will be possible to travel free of charge for the rest of the week and no further costs will be charged to the user. This will enable regular transport users to make substantial savings, for example, a passenger that takes the bus and metro to work and back five days a week would automatically save EUR 12.50 with the weekly travelcard.\nThe app has eradicated the need to queue to purchase a traditional paper ticket ever again or download multiple apps for different transport services. The 360Pass connects 5G Bluetooth sensors placed on services and stops around the city to identify when a passenger with the mobile app has boarded, how far they have travelled and when they disembarked. This allows users to pay the best possible fare even when using different transport means.\nIn addition to the commercial launch, through a new partnership with Trenitalia (Ferrovie dello Stato Group), app users will be able to travel on regional and intercity trains as well as public transport in the Ligurian capital. Users will also now be able to get the best weekly rate for their trips.\nThe 360Pass app ensures passengers have access to the fastest and most convenient multi-modal route options and real time journey updates. It also allows passengers to check how busy bus services are through the app and choose less crowded services as desired. Underlining the value of this technology, a recent study commissioned by Hitachi Rail on global attitudes to public transport found that 73% of people would be more likely to travel on public transport if they could see live information on crowding levels on services.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(140,'Railway PRO','Vegetable oil locomotive enters operation in the UK','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/vegetable-oil-locomotive-enters-operation-in-the-uk/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chiltern-Railways-326x245.jpg','July 31, 2023','2023-09-20 16:45:59','Chiltern Railways has put into service on July 27 the vegetable oil locomotive on its network, the first instance of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) being used in passenger service in the UK.\nThe operator’s Class 68 locomotive-hauled trains will be powered with this innovative fuel, derived from used cooking oils, tallows and other recyclable wastes, rather than conventional diesel, drastically reducing the impact the trains have on the environment and air quality across its network.\n“We are determined to operate a railway that is easier, greener, and better for our customers. The conversion of a key part of our fleet of trains to HVO fuel will make a big difference in terms of emissions. We have listened to customers and stakeholders who rightly highlighted air quality as a key concern to us, and have taken action to minimise the impact on the environment that these trains have through cleaner, greener fuel. This is a strong step in the right direction, and we want to do more. In the next few days, we will be inviting train manufacturers for proposals for new trains to replace our oldest diesel trains,” Richard Allan, Managing Director for Chiltern Railways, said.\nThe HVO fuel is made almost entirely from used cooking oils and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% and air particulates by 85%. A fossil free drop-in alternative to conventional diesel fuel, HVO contains few impurities and burns cleanly. It can reduce other emissions such as NOx and Carbon Monoxide, depending on engine type and usage.\nAlthough HVO fuel is more expensive to buy than conventional diesel, Chiltern has decided to switch to using HVO fuel as part of its plan to modernise and decarbonise its operations through the Right Route 2030 vision. The vegetable oil locomotive is part of company’s ambitious proposal that sets out how fleet renewal and modernisation over the next decade will make journeys easier, greener and better for Chiltern customers.\nAll HVO fuel used by Chiltern Railways has been previously used and recycled to power part of its fleet, and the conversion is another exciting opportunity to both decarbonise and improve customer experience.\nThe Class 68 locomotives being fuelled with HVO haul six Mark III coaches when they are in passenger service, providing seating for more than 300 customers in a spacious interior. Chiltern has 25 of these coaches, and 89 vehicles in the Class 165 diesel fleet that is 33 years old, and 85 vehicles in the Class 168 diesel fleet that is 23 years old.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(141,'Railway PRO','Ballard to deliver hydrogen fuel cells for CPKC','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/ballard-to-deliver-hydrogen-fuel-cells-for-cpkc/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canadian-Pacific-Kansas-City-326x245.jpg','July 31, 2023','2023-09-20 16:46:08','Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) ordered from Ballard Power Systems additional fuel cell engines for the new hydrogen locomotive programme.\nThe rail company will acquire 18 200 kW fuel cell engines that are planned to be delivered by the end of this year.\nOver the past two years, Ballard has supplied CPKC with 20 fuel cell engines for use in three different types of locomotives, with combined fuel cell power of 4MW.\n“Our hydrogen locomotive programme has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from locomotive operations, supporting the transition to a lower-carbon future in the freight rail sector. We are excited to expand development of these pioneering zero-emission locomotives with collaborators like Ballard,” Kyle Mulligan, AVP Operations Technology at CPKC said.\nThese locomotives have been undergoing field testing in 2022 and early 2023 with successful tests, proving the capabilities of Ballard’s hydrogen fuel cell technology in locomotive applications.\nFurther development on range across temperature variations, heavy hauling, fine tuning auxiliary load to avoid waste, increased number of hours on current and additional units will support continued technological evolution. The success of these trials, combined with the need to achieve CPKC’s emissions goals, has resulted in the significant expansion of the original hydrogen locomotive programme.\n“We are thrilled to support our partner, CPKC, as they expand their development of fuel cell-powered locomotives to decarbonize critical transportation routes. Our teams have been working hand-in-hand to ensure success of this program and we are excited for the future with CPKC to help scale their growing hydrogen fleet,” Seungsoo Jung, Ballard’s Vice President of Rail & Emerging Markets said.\nIn December 2020, Canadian Pacific Kansas City announced its plans to develop the first line-haul hydrogen locomotive in the North America by retrofitting a diesel freight locomotive with hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology to drive the locomotive’s electric traction motors.

These corridors were created to help Ukraine export its agricultural products after it was unable to use its Black Sea ports following the war triggered by Russia in February 2022.\nEven after the deal with Russia that allowed Ukrainian Black Sea ports to be used until last week, these land corridors continued to be used for Ukrainian exports. According to the EU agriculture commissioner, 60% of Ukraine’s agricultural exports were shipped by rail and road and 40% via Ukrainian Black Sea ports during the time the deal with Russia was in force.\nNow “we are ready to export almost everything” through the solidarity corridors created in EU countries neighbouring Ukraine, commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski told a press conference during a meeting of ministers in Brussels. “This is about four million tonnes of cereals and oilseeds and we reached this volume last November,” the Brussels official added.\nAfter the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Romania reopened several border crossing points for rail transport that had not been used for years, precisely to facilitate Ukraine’s exports. The railway system in the port of Constanta was also repaired and the wagons abandoned there for decades were freed.\nThe EC is working on a scheme to compensate transport costs for Ukrainian exports\nHe added that the European Commission is currently examining several initiatives from EU member states for a common scheme to cover transport costs for Ukrainian products exported by land, as road and rail transport is more expensive than sea transport.\nThe expansion of Ukrainian exports by land is a sensitive issue for EU countries neighbouring Ukraine, as large quantities of Ukrainian cereals that should only have transited through the solidarity corridors have remained in these countries, where they have been marketed below the prices that local producers can offer, and have therefore suffered losses that have been only partially compensated by the compensation approved by the European Commission.\nFinally, in April, the European Commission allowed the five Member States bordering Ukraine (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria) to ban imports of four Ukrainian agricultural products (wheat, maize, oilseed rape and sunflower seeds) until 15 September, provided that they do not hinder the transit of these products to other countries. Agriculture ministers from the five countries last week asked the European Commission to extend the import restrictions on the four Ukrainian products until at least the end of this year, with a broader list of products from Ukraine to be added.\nBut Kiev is calling for a return to the full opening of the EU market for all Ukrainian products, as the bloc decided after Russia started the war, and considers the extension of import restrictions by Ukraine’s neighbours “unacceptable”. France and Germany have also said they are opposed to extending these restrictions, while Poland has announced it will extend them anyway, even if the European Commission decides otherwise.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(153,'Railway PRO','HS2 seeks platform edge door supplier','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/hs2-seeks-platform-edge-door-supplier/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/HS2-Platform-view-at-Old-Oak-Common-326x245.jpg','July 26, 2023','2023-09-20 16:47:04','HS2 Ltd. has started the process to identify a specialist contractor to deliver HS2 platform edge doors for the new high speed railway’s Old Oak Common and Interchange stations.\nThe new contract opportunity is for a framework agreement which covers the platform barrier and automatic doors along the edge of the platforms.

This should be followed by technical tests and trials on the streets of the city. After approval by the Technical Supervisory Authority (TAB) of Darmstadt Regional Council, the first new trams can be put into regular operation from 2027.\nThey will run within the urban network operated by KVG which, in addition to Kassel itself, also includes Vellmar, Baunatal, Lossetal and other neighbouring areas.\nThe new vehicles will have a length of 30 m and an Albert coupling which allows for attachment of an additional motor car or trailer. Each of the trams will have four doors on each side for passengers to board and alight and, as a matter of course, a low-floor design to facilitate boarding and alighting for people with reduced mobility.\nThe trams for Kassel will be among the first from the Škoda Group to be equipped with advanced anti-collision system which increases safety and protects passengers and pedestrians.\nThe Škoda Group’s new anti-collision system creates a virtual tunnel in front of the tram in which it detects all static and dynamic obstacles and, if it detects one, alerts the driver and activates the emergency brake. The entire surrounding area is monitored by a suite of sensors which includes LiDAR, an IMU unit and a camera. The LiDAR is responsible for 3D mapping of the surrounding area within a range of 100-150 m in both horizontal and vertical fields of view. The IMU unit feeds information about the vehicle’s tilt into the system and helps the sensor output from the anti-collision system to reflect the profile of the track. The camera provides high-resolution 2D images which capture more detail.\n“Efficient and attractive local rail transport ensures a sustainable quality of life in cities. For this we need a strong vehicle fleet. Škoda produces well-designed and reliable trams and submitted the most cost-effective bid. This contract paves the way for the gradual modernisation of our public transport system, as this is a prerequisite for revamping mobility in Kassel and the surrounding area,“ Olaf Hornfeck, member of the board of directors of KVG, said.\nTramways are the backbone of Kassel public transport system and are carrying 48 million passengers a year representing 80 percent of the total number of passengers, with the remaining 20% covered by bus services.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(161,'Railway PRO','Sofia orders additional Inspiro metro trains','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/sofia-orders-additional-inspiro-metro-trains-2/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Metro-Inspiro-Sofia-Siemens-Mobility-i-Newag-1-326x245.jpg','July 24, 2023','2023-09-20 16:47:44','Simetro consortium, consisting of Siemens Mobility Bulgaria, Siemens Mobility Austria and Newag, has been appointed to deliver 8 additional Inspiro metro trains for Sofia metro Line 3.\nThe contract was signed by city’s metro operator Metropolitan EAD and the consortium on July 20, 2023 and also includes the installation of CBTC Trainguard MT on-board equipment, manufactured by Siemens Mobility.\nBGN 134 million (EUR 66.8 million) is the value of the contract under which the car bodies will be manufactured at the Siemens Mobility plant in Vienna, while final assembly and testing will take place in Nowy Sącz, Poland, by Newag.\nThe new trains will be deployed on the Line 3 extension expected to become operational in the second half of 2026.\nThe Inspiro platform has been developed with particular emphasis on low energy consumption, optimised maintenance, passenger safety and comfort, and meets the highest environmental requirements.

Apart from occasional runs, the last passenger train left Łomża in 1993.\nAlong the 77 km section of the railway line covered by the project, it is planned to reconstruct the railway infrastructure to serve passenger traffic. The implementation of the investment will enable the operation of regional and long-distance trains and the new platforms will be adapted to the needs of all travellers, including people with reduced mobility. Comfortable platforms equipped with sheds, benches, signals and LED lighting will provide access to trains in Konarzyce, Koziki, Czachy-Kołaki, Kulesze Kościelne, Sokoły and Śniadowo , where a new stop will be constructed.\nOn the Łapy – Śniadowo – Łomża route, the tracks and engineering structures will be reconstructed, and the control devices will be renewed. An additional 1 km rail section will be constructed in Śniadowo, on the direction from Białystok towards Łomża, which will provide more efficient journey as the trains will not need to change the direction at Śniadowo station.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nIn addition, it is planned to build a passing loop in Czerwony Bór, which will ensure the possibility of constructing a better timetable and greater punctuality of trains.The level of safety at the junctions with roads and tracks will increase due to the renovation and modernisation of rail-road crossings, some of which will be equipped with additional security measures.\n“The governmental programme Kolej Plus is dedicated for the construction, reconstruction and rival of railway infrastructure in Polish regions. Thanks to this agreement, the railway connections will return to Łomża. Cutting off the then provincial capital from rail transport in 1993 was a sad example of the irresponsible transport policy of Polish governments after 1989. We are systematically reversing these bad decisions and restoring hope to Polish citizens that, regardless of where they come from, they can count on the fact that today the Polish State is interested in their affairs and wants to solve their problems,” the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk said.\nThanks to the revitalisation of the line, over 60,000 residents of Łomża and inhabitants of four communes located along the line. After the works are completed, the trains between Łomża and Łapy will run at a maximum speed of 80-100 km/h. The travel time of the fastest train from Łomża to Białystok, after completing all works and obtaining the necessary permits, should be 1 hour 35 minutes. It is estimated that approximately 24,000 people will use the railway connection monthly.\nKolej Plus in Podlaskie province includes only this project covering the revitalisation and electrification  of the railway line No. 49 Łomża – Śniadowo, as well as electrification and reconstruction of infrastructure on the railway line No. 36 on the Śniadowo – Łapy section.\nThe Kolej Plus programme includes 35 projects to be implemented in 11 voivodeships to provide small towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants rail passenger connection where these services are not provided or increased access to railways.

EUR 1.3 billion is the value of the framework agreement which will be implemented within the next ten years.\nThe signing of the framework agreement and the initial order for 16 Cityjet battery trains is expected to take place in autumn 2023.\nThe first batch of Flirt Akku battery multiple units is expected to be in service along the Kamptalbahn route from 2028 and represents another measure that ÖBB is implementing to decarbonise rail transport in Austria.\nThe new trains are Flirt Akku multiple units – the battery-powered version of Stadler’s best-selling Flirt model, which has already sold over 2,500 units worldwide.\nThey are intended for use in the eastern region in Austria, where they will replace the current diesel fleet. The Flirt Akku model allows sustainable rail operation on non-electrified line sections by charging the traction batteries while travelling under an overhead contact line.\nStadler’s modern battery-powered vehicles can run both with and without overhead contact lines, and can be recharged during operation or even when braking. The Flirt Akku is the battery-operated version of Stadler’s Flirt model.\nThe vehicle has an operating range of around 100 kilometres. This means that the regional train can be battery operated on almost all of the non-electrified routes in Austria, for example. After successfully covering 224 kilometres in battery-only mode, the Flirt Akku holds the world record for the longest journey travelled by a regional train in battery-only mode without additional charging.\nAs well as delivering new trains for ÖBB, Stadler is also supplying 55 Flirt Akku battery trains for the Schleswig-Holstein local transport network, 44 trains for the Palatinate network and 14 trains for Deutsche Bahn’s H-Netz. The vehicles for Schleswig-Holstein are currently undergoing approval tests and will start passenger service later this year.

The main principle of the work of our international division will be in close ties with foreign partners, transparency and competition for the sake of a decent representation of Ukrzaliznytsia on the international arena,” Yevhen Lyashchenko, the chairman of the board of Ukrzaliznytsia said.\nIt is planned that at the first stage of its work, Ukrainian Railways Cargo Poland will provide a comprehensive cargo transport service, coordinate work with European operators, cargo owners, border crossings, operate rolling stock on the rail networks with 1435mm and 1520mm gauges, control the rolling stock of the company abroad, and fully ensuring the logistics process.\n“The creation of such a company is a must for the need of the development and growth of freight turnover between Ukraine and the European Union and is one of the main components of Ukrzaliznytsia’s strategy for the development of freight transportat by rail. It is also one of the priorities of the strategy of providing a comprehensive door-to-door transport service,” Vyacheslav Yeromin, a member of the board of Ukrzaliznytsia, explained.\nThe long-term strategy for the successful operation of the international division is at the final stage of development and will be approved by the supervisory board of Ukrzaliznytsia in the near future.\nIn June 2023, Ukrzaliznytsia increased the volume of cargo transport by 32% compared to the same period in 2022, to 12.4 million tonnes.Compared to May, this represents an increase of 8%.\nThe European Commission is striving to integrate the rail system of Ukraine and to support its infrastructure reconstruction and development. In June, an agreement was signed to allow Ukraine to benefit European funds through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for which transport projects can be submitted under the next call for proposals expected to be launched in September 2023. Priority will be given to the projects which promote connectivity to the European Union on the TEN-T core network.\nRecently, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank published a study which highlights the need of 1435mm gauge track extension to Ukraine (and to the Republic of Moldova) will help for the integration with the EU rail system.\nThe railway network in Ukraine is characterised by 1520mm-gauge lines excepting short sections near the border crossing points with EU member states.\nThe study says that ad Ukraine has a relatively high rail mode share (on both passenger and freight sectors), a planned transition towards 1435mm-gauge network can be possible if the current rail network retains its ability to efficiently accommodate current levels of demand and operations. After comprehensive analyses of the country’s railway system (including signalling and telecommunication, electrification, terminals and transshipment facilities, rolling stock, capacity, demands, etc.) it is not realistic for Ukraine to switch to a complete 1435mm gauge network but instead it is possible the creation of a network which combines 1520mm and 1435mm gauge tracks, the study explains.\nFor Ukraine, the study proposes that the first European track gauge links would be feasible for connection with Poland, from Kraków/Katowice to Lviv. Furthermore the study is providing additional new connections between Poland and Ukraine throughWarsaw and Kyiv and Warsaw and Lviv routes, and a connection towards Romanian border from Lviv, while the domestic 1435mm corridor would link Lviv and Kyiv and Kyiv and Kharkiv/Dnipro. The study recommends the establishment of a 1435mm backbone network which would allow the connection to the EU rail network through Romania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(168,'Railway PRO','Stadler to deliver narrow-gauge hydrogen trains in Italy','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/stadler-to-deliver-narrow-gauge-hydrogen-trains-in-italy/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stadler-Sardinia-train-326x245.jpg','July 21, 2023','2023-09-20 16:48:16','Italian railway operators Azienda Regionale Sarda Trasporti (ARST) and Ferrovie della Calabria (FdC) have awarded Stadler two framework agreements for the supply and maintenance of 10 narrow-gauge hydrogen trains for ARST in Sardinia and 15 similar vehicles for FdC in Calabria.

The Line C follows the same route as line B until the station Molière and then the same as line A between the stations of Foch-Maison Bleue and Angers-Roseraie, providing a direct route from the west side of the city to the train station. Tram Line A entered passenger services in 2011.\nThe Line A is designed on north-south axis from Avrillé-Ardennes to Angers-Roseraie running through the city centre. It is connected with Line B through two stations and its south section doubles the Line C.\nThe two new light rail lines serve 100,000 inhabitants representing 35% of the population of Angers Loire Métropole.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nDurand, Colas, Alstom, Ratp Dev are the partners who were involved in implementing the project of the tramway lines. Part of the Travaux Publics des Pays de Loire (TPPL) consortium, Colas was awarded one of the three urban development work packages.\nIn December 2019, Alstom was awarded a EUR 55 million contract to deliver 20 Citadis trams for the new tram lines B and C. These trams are in addition to the 17 Citadis LRVs ordered for Line A. The trams are 33 metres long, with 6 double doors per side, and are able to carry more than 210 passengers.\n“The deadlines for the completion of the two new tram lines in Angers were respected, despite the many crises – the pandemic and the shortage of materials in particular. This success is collective. Of course, I associate the patience of the Angers citizens during the works, and that, of course, of the traders,” Jean-Marc Verchère said.\nThe city’s tramway system together with the metropolitan bus network and the park and ride facilities, as well as the alternative transport services such as carpooling and the active mobility are creating a modern and sustainable public transport system in the city and its metropolitan area. The new tram lines play an essential role in connecting the districts of Belle-Beille and Monplaisir both of which are undergoing urban renewal.\nThe opening of the two new lines will allow a 25% increase in the number of bus and tram users by 2027.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(171,'Railway PRO','Škoda to supply traction motors for Melbourne’s new trams','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/skoda-to-supply-traction-motors-for-melbournes-new-trams/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yarra-Trams-326x245.jpg','July 19, 2023','2023-09-20 16:48:33','Škoda Group was awarded a contract to deliver up to 1,120 tram traction motors for Melbourne’s new fleet manufactured by Alstom.

The new locomotives are expected to be delivered in 2026.\nThe three 100% battery powered FLXdrive locomotives will be used on the Carajás Railroad (EFC) in Brazil, which runs the world’s largest iron ore train consisting of 330 railcars transporting 45,000 tons. Today, three to four diesel locomotives pull the train.\nOnce delivered, the FLXdrives will join the diesel locomotives to form Brazil’s first hybrid consist pulling the train uphill for 140 km in Açailândia, in the state of Maranhão, where fuel consumption is the highest. The FLXdrives will replace the two diesel locomotives, known as “dynamic helpers,” that are used to pull the train uphill today.\nThe FLXdrive battery locomotives will be built at Wabtec’s plant in Contagem, in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil.\nThe FLXdrive locomotive’s energy management system recharges the batteries along the route as the train brakes. “It’s what we call regenerative energy produced by dynamic braking. Today, that energy is lost when a traditional locomotive brakes. In the downhill sections, we will be able to recharge the batteries, without having to stop the train’s operation,” Alexandre Silva, Manager of Vale’s Powershift Programme said.\nVale introduced the Powershift Programme to study alternative technologies to replace fossil fuels with clean sources in the company’s operations.\nThe FLXdrive locomotives are estimated to save 25 million litres of diesel per year, considering the consumption of all the railway’s trains that use the dynamic helper. This savings would reduce carbon emissions by approximately 63,000 tons, the equivalent emissions of around 14,000 passenger cars per year.\n“Initially, we are maximising energy efficiency, replacing the diesel locomotives in the dynamic helper with battery ones, but the idea is that, in the future, the other locomotives on the train can be fueled by ammonia. This way, we would have a clean operation at EFC,” Vale’s Director of Energy, Ludmila Nascimento said.\nThe two companies will work together on a study to use ammonia as a clean alternative fuel, which does not emit CO2. The study will initially be carried out as lab tests to validate performance, emission reductions, and feasibility. Among the advantages of ammonia is the fact that it allows the locomotive a longer range than other carbon-free fuels. In addition, ammonia has a high-octane rating and an established large-scale distribution infrastructure. The two companies will carry out the study in a laboratory over the next two years.\nIn 2020, Vale announced an investment of between USD 4 and 6 billion to reduce its direct and indirect emissions by 33% by 2030. Currently, Vale’s rail network represents 10% of the company’s carbon emissions. The initiative is one more step towards achieving the goal of zero emissions net carbon emissions by 2050, in line with the ambition of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to below 2°C by the end of the century.\nThe company also committed to reducing its net emissions from its value chain by 15% by 2035.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(178,'Railway PRO','Amtrak begins procurement for new maintenance facilities','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/amtrak-begins-procurement-for-new-maintenance-facilities/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amtrak-train-facility-326x245.jpg','July 18, 2023','2023-09-20 16:49:11','Amtrak has published two Requests for Qualifications (RFQs) that will help deliver new and upgraded train maintenance facilities in Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C.\nFunded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Amtrak’s facilities upgrade programme will prepare more than 20 sites around the country for new trainsets scheduled to enter service in the coming years.\nSix major maintenance facilities will receive significant upgrades to support preventive maintenance, routine inspections, equipment repairs and minor service and cleaning needs.

A total of 21,000 km of track needs to be built and upgraded across Europe. Thus, the routes designed for high-speed rail service would be nearly tripled and will allow trains to reach speeds of 300 km/h on the new network.\nThe Metropolitan Network project aims at connecting all 230 metropolitan regions, defined as urban agglomerations of more than 250,000 inhabitants, and large cities in Europe to the high-speed rail network with HSR service at least once an hour. If expansion will be in place, around 60% of Europeans that live in the metropolitan regions would have direct access to high-speed rail, even in regions where there are no fast rail links at all today.\nDeutsche Bahn says that for Germany, the high speed rail expansion means that if the network upgrade were to include the lines already under construction and planned, the high-speed infrastructure in this country would grow to cover 6,000 km. Poland would also be a winner, increasing its network more than tenfold, by 2,760 km from today’s 224 km.\nThe proposal on the European high-speed rail expansion will support the achievement of the European Green Deal to double the high-speed rail by 2030 and to tiple it by 2050 allowing it to make an important contribution to reducing carbon emissions in the transport sector. This will help Europe to cut transport emissions by 90% in 2050, in accordance with the European policy.\n“A tripling of high-speed rail traffic in Europe is possible. Once the infrastructure is in place, millions of people on the continent will benefit from attractive connections and faster travel times. The rail countries in central and western Europe, and even more so in southern and eastern Europe, will enjoy the advantages. According to our calculations and simulations, this will result in faster travel times on entirely new corridors and via new traffic hubs on rail,” Michael Peterson, the Member of the Management Board for Long Distance Passenger Transport at DB said.\nThe rail companies involved in the study want to discuss this with politicians in the fall. The infrastructure measures currently being planned or built are not sufficient to achieve a doubling of high-speed rail traffic by 2030.\nIn January 2023, a study published by EU-RAIL, AllRail, CER and UNIFE highlights that all the capitals and major cities need to be connected to an extended high-speed network which would have a length of 49.400 km in 2040 (in the 2050 scenario). Part of the TEN-T core network, the high speed system would have 20.500 km, providing connections to additional 86 million people.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(182,'Railway PRO','Public consultation for Rail Baltica regional stations','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/public-consultation-for-rail-baltica-regional-stations/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rail-Baltica-station-326x245.jpg','July 17, 2023','2023-09-20 16:49:37','Alternatives for the development of Rail Baltica regional stations on the section from Kaunas to the Lithuanian – Latvian border are being presented to the public which is invited to actively participate and cooperate in the territorial planning process by submitting comments and proposals for public consideration of the project.\n“One of the main objectives of Rail Baltica is to integrate the capitals of the Baltic States into the European railway network. Of no less importance is that the new European standard-gauge railway will ensure faster connectivity on regional routes and with major Lithuanian cities – Kaunas, Jonava, and Panevėžys,” the Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications Loreta Maskaliovienė said.\nAt least seven Rail Baltica regional stations and stops are planned to be constructed along the section including the Vaškai passenger (border) station, the Joniškėlis commercial and passenger station, the Ramygala passenger stop, the Pasraučiai passenger stop, the Ručiūnai passenger stop, and the Jonava commercial station and passenger stop.\nA total of two regional station development alternatives will be presented for each station. The priority development alternative was selected following a strategic environmental assessment (SEA), during which not only environmental but also social and economic factors were evaluated. A multi-criteria evaluation and cost-benefit analysis of both alternatives have also already been carried out.\nThe preparation of the special plan for regional stations involves an assessment of the current situation; general and concrete solutions are formed in preparing the alternatives for the development of Rail Baltica, and the specific land is identified, which, after the approval of the special plan, will be acquired for public purposes. In preparing the special plan, the impact of the planned infrastructure on the environment is also assessed.\nThe public can become acquainted with the concept document for the special transport communications engineering infrastructure development plan and the strategic environmental impact assessment report from 27 June 2023 to 26 July 2023.\n“On the most mature section of Rail Baltica from Kaunas to the Latvian border, construction work is not only intensifying, but the planning of areas needed for regional stations is continuing as well.

The main objective of the contract for the approximately 11 km long section is the issuance of a zoning decision, the preparation of documentation for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the construction, and the evaluation of the construction’s economic efficiency.\nThe project includes the connection to existing infrastructure, modification of existing infrastructure and construction of a new one.\nIt also includes the reconstruction of the existing track on the section Ústí nad Labem západ – Chabařovice or the design of a maintenance center for the new VRT in the Chabařovice station location.\nIn 2021, Správa železnic and DB Netz selected ILF Consulting Engineers Austria to prepare the documentation for the zoning decision for the Krušnohorský tunnel which will connect Heidenau and Ústí nad Labem. The work is expected to be completed in 2024.\nThe Krušnohorský tunnel (Ore Mountains Tunnel) is designed to allow mixt traffic (passenger and freight trains), while there will be more connections transporting goods on the line.Mixed traffic in the tunnel will allow the transfer of up to 150 trains a day from the Elbe Valley and will significantly contribute to reducing noise on the existing line to Dresden.\nIn January 2021, the Ministry of Transport has approved the feasibility study for the new Prague – Dresden railway line with the first section between Prague and Litoměřice which will be used for passenger transport at speeds of up to 320 km/h. The section across Central Bohemian Uplands (in northern Bohemia, Czech Republic) and further to Germany will also be used by freight trains, thanks to which traffic in the narrow Labe (Elbe) Valley will be relieved. The Prague – Ústí nad Labem – Dresden high-speed line consists of the Středohorské and Ore Mountains tunnels. In the tunnel under the Central Bohemian Uplands, passenger trains will run at speeds of up to 250 km/h and in the Krušnohorský (Ore Mountains) tunnel 200 km/h. The Středohorský tunnel under Central Bohemian Uplands will be 18 km long, while the Krušnohorský tunnel will have 26 km of which 11.7 km in the Czech Republic and the remaining 14.3 km on German territory.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nFor the extension of the high-speed line in southern Moravia, Správa železnic and the joint venture of Valbek, Mott MacDonald and Egis Rail signed a contract for the development of documentation for land use planning (DÚR) and documents for the EIA process of assessing the effects of construction on the environment.\nThe contract covers the preparation of the technical design of the Šakvice – Rakvice high-speed rail (VRT) section that will extend the already planned VRT South Moravia by approximately 10 km.Originally, this line was supposed to connect to the existing Brno – Břeclav near Šakvice corridor.\nThe South Moravian connection, being prepared from Modřice, was originally supposed to connect to the existing Brno – Břeclav near Šakvice corridor, but the ongoing design work shows that the proposal from the feasibility study would limit future traffic on the line. Thus a new double-track above-grade railway will allow trains to operate at a speed of 230 km/h. The relocation of the connection was recommended and also approved by the Ministry of Transport.\nThe work schedule assumes obtaining a zoning decision in 2025 and the construction is expected to start approximately two years later. The line will be used exclusively for passenger traffic, and trains will travel at a speed of 320 km/h.\nThe 41 km South Moravia high-speed line from Brno to Šakvice is part of the international connection of the Czech Republic with Austria and Slovakia and, in a broader sense, belongs to the connection between the capitals of the V4 countries. This section is expected to be commissioned in 2030.\nBoth sections will become part of the new high-speed line from Brno to Břeclav, which after its completion will reduce the journey time by 10 minutes compared to the existing line.\nThe construction of a new high-speed railway in the Brno – Rakvice section and the modernisation of the existing line further to Břeclav will ensure a quality connection to Slovakia and Austria. VRT Praha – Brno – Ostrava / Břeclav will form the basis of a network of high-speed railway system in the Central Europe. The line will also be used to the connections towards Budapest or Warsaw.\nThe Czech high-speed rail strategy was approved in 2017 and is part of the TEN-T, with plans expected to complete the first sections in 2030 to be integrated into the Core Network.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(186,'Railway PRO','Alstom builds a new rail plant in Morocco','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/alstom-builds-a-new-rail-plant-in-morocco/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alstom-Morocco-326x245.png','July 17, 2023','2023-09-20 16:49:55','Alstom announced it will invest USD 16.67 million (160 million dirhams) to construct a second rail plant in Morocco, which will make driving cabs for regional and underground railway trains.\nThis latest investment will create 200 direct jobs between now and 2025.\nIn 2020, Alstom Morocco announced the expansion of its plant in Fez, and in 2021, the construction of a second production line.\nThe Fez site produces electrical wiring and Mitrac transformers and employs 850 people, of whom 56% are women. This second rail plant in Morocco, will make driving cabs and is fully in keeping with the group’s commitment to develop the Moroccan rail ecosystem and build local rail expertise.\n“We are extremely proud to be building a new industrial site.

This way, train inspectors can focus on the remaining images, and this helps them improve both efficiency and accuracy.\n“The capability of the Pangu Railway large model is continuously improved. The fault detection omission rate is zero, and the screening rate of fault-free images is as high as 95%,” Zhang Pingan, Huawei Executive Director and CEO of Huawei Cloud said.\nThis AI-based solution has revolutionised the fault identification process, guaranteeing safer railway operations and enhancing reliability.\nThe Pangu Railway Model also uses continuous learning to improve performance. If abnormalities are detected, they can be manually labelled, and added to the model to improve detection performance.\nAdditionally, the Pangu Railway Model supports concurrent detection on distributed servers, significantly reducing the time required for fault detection. Using a two-node solution, the detection process for a train is completed within 8 minutes. The faster detection process ensures timely identification of faults, mitigating risks and enhancing overall railway safety.\nWith its exceptional accuracy, improved efficiency, and faster detection capabilities, Huawei’s Pangu Railway Model solution is setting a new standard for fault identification in the railway sector.\nTrain detection systems sit alongside and in-between the tracks of railways systems. When a train passes the detection station, TFDS calculates the train speed using the magnetic steel sensors on wheels. It automatically adjusts the snapshot frequency to match the train passing time, usually one picture taken every few milliseconds. These are then uploaded to a central server for fault detection. Due to technical limitations, traditionally most of the fault identification work is done manually.\nA typical depot in China monitors more than 40,000 trains running on 800 lines every day making it extremely difficult to conduct manual checks. The TFDS system takes around 80 pictures for each freight carriage, as each train has around 50 carriages this results in thousands of pictures being taken for each train. Due to the sheer volume of pictures taken, inspectors only have around 10 minutes to manually check each batch for faults and cracks in the undercarriages.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(193,'Railway PRO','EUR 23 million funding for Moldovan Railways','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/eur-23-million-funding-for-moldovan-railways/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFM-326x245.jpg','July 12, 2023','2023-09-20 16:50:33','The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is lending EUR 23 million to support the rehabilitation of two railway section of Moldova’s North-South Rail Corridor, part of the EU Solidarity Lanes initiative to improve transport to and from Ukraine.\nWith road and rail traffic between Ukraine and the European Union expected to increase further once Ukrainian reconstruction gets underway, the project has also attracted an investment grant of up to EUR 20 million from the European Union via its Foreign Policy Needs instrument.\nIn May 2023, the EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso and European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis signed an agreement to support the project, while the EBRD Head of Office in Moldova Angela Sax signed both loan and grant agreements with Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development Liliana Dabija on June 27, 2023.\nThe final EUR 28 million of co-financing for the EUR 71 million project will come from Moldovan Railways (Calea Ferata din Moldova – CFM), which will be responsible for implementing the project.\nThe rehabilitation of Moldova’s North-South Rail Corridor will increase country’s logistics and transit potential and bring operational efficiency from improved regional infrastructure through the rehabilitation of Valcinet – Balti – Ungheni rail section and Chisinau – Cainari section in the second phase.\nThe EBRD funds and EU grant will finance the acquisition of materials needed to rehabilitate the sections of line.

Further extensions are also suggested. The study also assesses the way in which the new standard gauge lines in Ukraine and Moldova would work with the network elsewhere in these countries, which will continue to use broad gauge.\nThe study analysed the barriers remaining, including the difference of rail gauge used in most of the EU versus the one used in Eastern Europe. The Connecting Europe Facility II has recently selected nine projects for funding that will aim at improving crossing points. The Commission has also to extend the Trans European Network–Transport to Ukraine and Moldova.\nConstructing the first European track gauge lines in Ukraine and Moldova will boost the connection with Poland and Romania and “will bring them closer to the EU single market.

This, in turn, hinders the functioning of the Single Market. Delays due to congestion caused by uncoordinated maintenance work are also common.\nThe proposal for a regulation on the use of railway infrastructure capacity in the single European railway area builds on the industry-led Timetable Redesign Project. The aim is to better respond to the different needs of the rail sector: stable timetables and early booking of tickets for passenger services, and flexible train runs adapted to just-in-time supply chains for freight shippers.\nBoosting EU rail freight transport, passengers will also benefit from additional rail services as the capacity of the network will be better used, impacting positively the cross-border services by enabling more frequent connections and earlier ticket booking, among others.\nThe proposal also includes new incentives for using low-emission lorries as it aims to reduce emissions and to promote vehicles using zero-emission technologies. The current Weights and Dimensions Directive sets the maximum weight length, width and height for heavy-duty vehicles. Once the technology develops and zero-emission propulsion systems become lighter, thanks also to the use of aerodynamic devices and cabs, cleaner vehicles will benefit from additional loading payload in comparison to conventional lorries.\nThe Commission is also proposing the CountEmissionsEU, a common methodological approach for companies to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions if they choose to publish this information, or if they are asked to share it for contractual reasons. The proposed methodology is based on the recently adopted ISO/CEN standard for the quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions arising from the operation of transport chains of passengers and freight. Reliable data on door-to-door emissions will enable operators to benchmark their services and allow consumers to make informed choices on transport and delivery options.\nThe European freight sector is responsible for over 30% of transport CO2 emissions. And as the EU economy grows, emissions are likely to rise unless decarbonisation measures are put in place: freight transport is expected to grow by around 25% by 2030, and 50% by 2050.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(201,'Railway PRO','TVZ builds new generation of Ivolga train','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/tvz-builds-new-generation-of-ivolga-train/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ivolga-train3-326x245.jpg','July 11, 2023','2023-09-20 16:51:18','Tver Carriage Works (TVZ), part of TMH, has started the construction of Ivolga 4.0 train, the new generation of rolling stock to be put into operation on the Moscow Central Diameters (MCDs).\nCurrently, on the MCD-2 the Ivolga 3.0 trains are operating and they will be also deployed on the MCD-3, which will be launched soon.\nCompared to the existing train fleet, the Ivolga 4.0 train has three doors on each car to ensure the fastest passenger exchange between the platform and the train, especially during the peak hours and on such busy routes as the MCD-3 and the MCD-4.\nIvolga 4.0 trains will be able to gain the same speed as the cars of the previous model – the Ivolga 3.0, able to run at 160 km/h.

In addition, station precincts in Albury, Wagga Wagga and Forbes will be enhanced and an additional crossing loop will be constructed at Daroobalgie.\nFor the section between Albury (at border) and Illabo in New South Wales, Inland Rail will benefit from track upgrades and modification works to be undertaken at locations to allow for safe clearance of double-stacked freight trains. On this section, works include enhancements to the rail tracks, footbridges and road bridges, overhead structures, signal structures and level crossings.\nThis Inland Rail section is already at the standard required to meet future operational demands, but enhancements and modifications are needed for the structures to allow double-stacked freight trains. In addition, some tracks at different locations will be moved to provide clearance between tracks and others will be lowered to provide clearance under some road bridges. In the first year of operation on Albury – Illabo section, near Albury, an additional two trains a day are expected, increasing from 12 to 14. A daily peak of 20 trains a day is forecast by 2040.\nThe track will enable the use of double-stacked, 1,800metre-long trains with a 21-tonne axle load at a maximum speed of 115km/h. In addition, if environmental assessment and approvals are obtained, the plans underline that future upgrades will be performed to accommodate 3,600metre-long trains.\nBetween Illabo and Stockinbingal, the project comprises the construction of 37 km of new track and upgrades on 2 km of existing track, called the Bethungra Spiral, on the Main South line. This section creates a new direct route from east of Illabo tracking north to Stockinbingal in New South Wales.\nThe Stockinbingal – Parkes section will be also upgraded to allow the operation of double-stacked trains and a new crossing loop will be built to increase capacity on the line. Along this 170.3 km line, enhancement and modification works are required to create height and width clearance to accommodate double-stacked freight trains. Planned works include the increasing vertical clearances on the Lachlan River rail bridge in Forbes, and under the Wyndham Avenue Road bridge, also in Forbes. Works also cover the construction of a new crossing loop north of the Daroobalgie Road level crossing.\nOther clearance and safety works cover the modification of the railway station in Forbes and several existing crossing loops, structures and utilities along the line.\n“We are delighted to bring Martinus Rail on board to conduct the enhancement works on the Stockinbingal to Parkes and Albury to Illabo sections of Inland Rail, an extremely important milestone for our project. Although we are still working on securing our final environmental approvals, we are very much looking forward to starting work on Stockinbingal to Parkes and bringing Inland Rail to life in these very important sections,” Melvyn Maylin, the Director of Programme Delivery for Inland Rail Albury – Parkes section.\nThe work for this section of Australia’s most important rail freight corridor is a key milestone towards Inland Rail being completed between Beveridge in Victoria and Parkes in New South Wales by 2027. The entire line from Albury to Parkes will accommodate double-stacked freight trains taking freight volumes off the road in more than 20 regional towns along with easing congestion on some of Australia’s busiest highways.\nDue to its complexity, Inland Rail is split into 12 individual projects spanning 1,700 km from Melbourne to Brisbane efficiently connecting Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

CPK’s approval of the airport’s concept design, prepared by the British consortium Foster + Partners and Buro Happold, means that CPK project has moved on to the next stage, implying the development of the construction project. The company honoured its commitment from last November, when it concluded the contract with the Master Architect.\n“I am convinced that this modern architecture, which was developed with the world-leading designers, will create gigantic business opportunities, attract foreign investments and stimulate economically not only Poland, but the entire region of Central and Eastern Europe,” said Deputy Minister for Funds and Regional Policy Marcin Horała, Government Plenipotentiary for CPK.\nThe centrepiece of the CPK multimodal transport hub is an atrium, seamlessly connecting the airport terminal, railway station, and other modes of transport under a singular, unifying canopy. The atrium is the ‘foreground of the airport’, the link between the terminal and the railway station – an accessible space where all passengers meet, regardless of which mode of transport they are using.\nThe atrium is located before security control, meaning it is accessible to all. It is also a place where employees and guests of the nearby Airport City will spend their time. The interface between the terminal and the surrounding area is unique. Typically, terminal buildings are difficult to access on foot. CPK’s solution creates pedestrian-friendly areas between the Airport City and airport’s infrastructure.\nThe airport’s passenger terminal, covering an area of approximately 400,000 m2, will be located on two levels, and arrival and security checks are both Schengen and non-Schengen. Once they have been through security, non-Schengen passengers will descend to another level, where they will have their own part of the terminal, with restaurants and shops.\nThe terminal will directly connect to four modular piers, with the potential for future expansion according to market demand. In all areas of the terminal, here will be two-way moving walkways for passengers, which will minimise transfer times and increase the standard of service.\nIn addition to conventional check-in desks, the terminal will be equipped with self-service check-in stations, a self-bag drop and kiosks with biometric capabilities. Both security and document control will be fully automated with CT scanners and automated gates.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe railway station will accommodate the needs of CPK’s operations and serve as a national transport hub, integrating rail connections from major cities in Poland. The CPK railway station consists of 6 underground platforms (12 tracks) serving regional and long-distance trains. The platforms will be covered in such a way that it will be possible to reach the station, which will be located in the atrium on the north side of the terminal and connected to it, comfortably and dry-shod.\nDirect, convenient access from the railway station to both the bus station and Airport City will be provided. The interchange will feature bus bays, waiting areas equipped with ticket counters, and retail facilities. Hotels are planned in the vicinity of the bus station, marking the initial developments of Airport City.\nThe first phase of the airport – two parallel runways and infrastructure to handle 40 million passengers, is expected to be operational in 2028. The CPK General Plan assumes that the airport will be expanded in a modular manner afterwards. According to the forecast of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the airport could handle up to 65 million passengers in 2060.\n“We are demonstrating how we are going to ensure passenger comfort and how we combine different modes of transport in one place. As of today, we know what the terminal, the heart of CPK and the aviation gateway to the world, is going to look like. For those arriving, this will be the first experience of our country. We are also unveiling the first railway station so closely integrated with an airport,” Mikołaj Wild, CEO of CPK said.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(216,'Railway PRO','ÖBB orders additional Kiss double-decker EMUs','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/obb-orders-additional-kiss-double-decker-emus/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/oebb_railjet_kiss-326x245.jpg','July 7, 2023','2023-09-20 16:52:30','The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) ordered 35 new double-decker multiple units from Stadler, exercising an option under a framework agreement from February 2022. EUR 600 million is the value of these vehicles expected to be deployed in stages from mid-2026.\nUnder the contract, Stadler will deliver 14 of which are six-car trains for long-distance services and 21 are four-car Kiss vehicles for local transport. The deployment of the new trains is planned in stages from mid-2026.\nThe new double-decker multiple units offer around 380 seats in the four-car configuration for local transport. The six-car long-distance trains provide around 480 seats in 1st and 2nd class increasing the capacity by 19% and have two catering zones. They can reach a maximum speed of 200 km/h.\n“At ÖBB, the passenger boom continues. Long-distance transport recorded a total of 41.6 million passengers in 2022 – even surpassing our previous record year of 2019. Not only are we very proud of this result, but we are also implementing other measures to further increase capacity on our trains. We are investing in the heart of our long-distance service – the Railjet – and will be adding modern Railjet double-decker trains to the existing fleet for the first time,” ÖBB CEO Andreas Matthä said.\nWhen designing the new train, special consideration was given to the wishes and requirements of passengers for their daily journeys to and from work and during their leisure time. Every single car has a low-floor entrance and an optimised multi-purpose area with more space and accessibility for passengers with bicycles, pushchairs or luggage. This spaciously designed multi-purpose area is directly connected to the boarding and alighting areas, enabling passengers to enter and exit quickly. The new multiple units are adapted to passengers with limited mobility which benefit dedicated wheelchair spaces with new, height-adjustable side wall tables in the middle car of the compositions. Each of the 160m long distance trains provide 8 bicycle parking space.\nThe new trains are equipped with a modern passenger information system (monitors with real-time information) and video surveillance.\nLast year, the two companies signed a EUR 3 billion framework agreement for the supply of up to 186 double-decker multiple units. In the first call, ÖBB ordered 41 Kiss double-decker EMUs in April 2022 and a further 21 four-car trains totalling EUR 300 million are now to follow on the second call with. Including the first call-off, 76 vehicles were ordered.

For brake\ntechnology approval, the static and dynamic tests took place according to EN 14033, while for the acoustics measurements, the tests were performed according to TSI Noise 2014/1304/EU. The project will be completed in the course of the summer.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe two rail inspection vehicles are of the type “Track Recording Vehicle VMB” and an “Ontrack Inspection Car”. A particularly interesting aspect of this project was that Ireland, as a member state of the EU, has to apply the European regulations, but the Irish railway system differs considerably from that in continental Europe especially considering the track gauge that in Ireland is 1,600 mm instead of the standard gauge of 1,435 mm in the rest of Europe. It is therefore necessary to apply the respective sets of rules, taking into account the specific conditions in Ireland.\n“The deep understanding of the railway system available at PJM was very helpful here, and it was thus possible to demonstrate compliance with the requirements from the sets of rules under the special boundary conditions in Ireland,” Martin Joch, the CEO of PJ Messtechnik GmbH said.\nAs an accredited test center according to ISO/IEC 17025, PJ Messtechnik GmbH carries out tests worldwide for the approval of rail vehicles in the areas of running technology, strength, braking, acoustics and aerodynamics.

It is a categoric and clear decision in favour of a level playing field between DB and digital platforms. Having recognised DB’s anti-competitive behaviour over many years, this decision provides not only the framework so that millions of people will access the benefits of digital innovation and choice but also sets a vital precedent for the ticketing sector in Germany and Europe,” Jody Ford, CEO of Trainline said.\nImportantly, the inclusion of the well-established economic principle LRAIC, sets a critical standard in establishing the calculation methodology necessary to ensure viable remuneration for independent retailers.\nEffective competition cannot exist in the absence of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions, without proper remuneration the benefits of independent retail, for customers and for the environment, will not be delivered.\nRecent actions by competition authorities in Europe, including the European Commission’s investigation on Renfe, show that regulators at both the EU and national level recognise the opportunity for growing sustainable travel when independent ticket distributors are allowed to compete on fair terms, with equal access and are able to innovate on behalf of customers. The effect is clear, requiring railway undertakings to provide equal access and viable remuneration to third party ticket vendors.\nFurther, the sharing of real-time data, lifting of marketing restrictions and enabling equal discounting of tickets, all contribute to making it possible to create an environment that is favourable to competition and innovation in the benefit of consumers. “We therefore call upon DB to rapidly comply with all the principles defined by BKartA,” Trainline says.\nBy adopting a strong position, BKartA becomes a leader in shaping the new framework for competition in rail for independent ticket distributors, one which is based on creation of a level playing field for all market participants.\n“The services provided by mobility platforms to enable integrated route planning for travellers would be inconceivable without the integration of Deutsche Bahn’s offerings and traffic data. For this reason, Deutsche Bahn is subject to antitrust abuse control and has special obligations vis-à-vis other companies…Without effective antitrust enforcement, the business models of mobility platforms cannot function in competition with Deutsche Bahn,”Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt (BKartA) said.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(220,'Railway PRO','Knorr-Bremse signs contract for Arlanda Express fleet','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/knorr-bremse-signs-contract-for-arlanda-express-fleet/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arlanda-express-schweden-326x245.jpg','July 6, 2023','2023-09-20 16:52:48','Knorr-Bremse has signed an important service agreement with Swedish operator A-Train AB covering the brake control units for Arlanda Express trains which provide transport services between Arlanda Airport and the city of Stockholm.\nThe service contract, which runs to the end of 2028, comprises two modules. The first one involves a refreshment service for overhauls that will extend the operating lifetime of the braking systems by reducing failure rates and so help to enable smooth, trouble-free train operation. The second one is a proactive obsolescence management service to ensure the availability of electronic components, for example by stockpiling discontinued parts. This will support the timely repair and reliable operation of the braking systems over the long term.\nFor the Arlanda Express trains that transport passengers between the city and the airport at speeds of up to 200 km/h, these services are vitally important. The trains’ braking systems have been in operation for over 20 years and are increasingly affected by the discontinuation of electronic components. A challenge which Knorr-Bremse’s service package now overcomes as part of a holistic approach to rail vehicle life cycle management.\nKnorr-Bremse’s Parts Availability Service offers customers tailor-made service packages that fulfil their requirements for smooth, reliable train operation. Since the service was introduced about two years ago, a double-digit number of customers have ordered optimised packages, including A-Train AB. Over the same period, sales of Knorr-Bremse’s Parts Availability Service packages have increased by 67%, reflecting the sector’s growing need for flexible solutions over the whole rail vehicle life cycle.\nThe contract will safeguard the operation of the express train fleet comprising seven trains that carry a large part of the traffic to and from Stockholm Arlanda Airport.\n“This order for the Arlanda Express – one of Stockholm’s major mobility options – highlights the rail sector’s growing need for customized service solutions that keep rail operations efficient and available for passengers,” said Frank Uder, Vice President RailServices of Knorr-Bremse Rail Vehicle Systems.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(221,'Railway PRO','Alstom to maintain Masovian Twindexx coach fleet','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/alstom-to-maintain-masovian-twindexx-coach-fleet/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Masovia-Twindexx-contract-326x245.jpg','July 6, 2023','2023-09-20 16:52:54','Koleje Mazowieckie, the regional rail operator in the Mazovian Voivodeship awarded Alstom a contract to carry out P5 maintenance of 37 Twindexx double-deck coaches.

This node will be the first high-speed rail and air traffic connection centre in the Baltic region.\n“The direct air and rail connection will be of significant benefit to Latvia, with its positive impact on transport, passenger, and cargo flows evident as soon as the connection is established. Over the long term, we will experience its substantial contribution to the economy and transformative effects on travel habits,” Transport Minister of Latvia Jānis Vitenbergs said.\nCurrently, one of the most significant infrastructure construction works has been completed in terms of volume – the construction of the railway station building and the installation of 534 piles for the adjacent platforms. These piles are unique because they are required by the railway infrastructure to withstand heavy loads and are designed to accommodate the train’s maximum permissible speed of 120 km/h. As a result, the piles are larger than usual, with a diameter of 1180 mm and a depth of 33 metres for the platforms, while the piles for the station building’s foundation have a diameter of 1000 mm and a depth of up to 30 meters. Taking into consideration the well-being of visitors, employees, and individuals working near Riga Airport, drilling technology was used instead of pile driving on the construction site.\nThe construction of the baggage transport tunnel, which will connect the Rail Baltica railway station with the new terminal of Riga Airport, is also nearing completion. Passengers’ luggage will be safely transported in both directions through the tunnel using a conveyor system, thus linking the railway and air traffic. This marks the completion of the first phase out of five, with planned sequential work to ensure uninterrupted airport operations throughout the construction period. It is worth noting that the construction of engineering communication networks is underway across the construction site, with a total length already exceeding 40 km.\nMost of the work is focused on underground structures and communication networks. However, in the future, as the construction of the station building’s framework, platforms, and passenger platforms commences, the outlines of above-ground structures will also become visible. A significant amount of work is involved in constructing the future parking lot and reconstructing the airport access roads. In the next phase, the construction of railway platforms will take place from the future station, both towards Imanta suburb, extending to the aviation hangars, and towards Jaunmārupe suburb. Throughout the project, a 4.5 km high-speed railway line will be built, encompassing the platform, embankment, and high-speed railway stations at multiple levels, providing multifunctional infrastructure that meets the requirements of passenger comfort.\nRail Baltica passenger terminal at Riga Airport will serve as the first high-speed railway and air traffic connection hub in the Baltics. A modern, multifunctional passenger service complex will be established, seamlessly integrated with the airport infrastructure, offering passengers new mobility options and enhanced convenience.\nUpon completion of the new terminal construction, a pedestrian bridge and square will connect the Rail Baltica railway station and the airport. Airport passengers will have access not only to the international high-speed train, which is scheduled to operate four times a day but also to regularly running regional commuter trains. The construction of Rail Baltica in Latvia involves a phased approach, gradually initiating the operation of the railway line.

This is the pre-commissioning phase of the South Shore section between Brossard and Gare Centrale stations.\nGroupe PMM – Operation and Maintenance, the company responsible for network operation and maintenance, simulates a series of typical service days, with frequent passages. The entity is testing the way trains are functioning at the storage centre, the automated departure and return of cars from storage to the tracks, the fleet management based on cleaning and maintenance requirements, service schedule management and overall rail system reliability as well as other elements.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nBesides the regular service trials, the teams are carrying out the “degraded mode” simulations, in which a malfunction or breakdown is simulated at random every day. This for example includes the management and controlling the beginning of a fire or a door blocked in the station by a person in the control room. The teams must apply the appropriate procedures for the simulated incident, as in reality. In particular, this enables us to test troubleshooting procedures in the control room and on the tracks, the coordination of actions launched between the field and the control station, as well as safety and service quality procedures. The simulations also cover the implementation of the downgraded situation management plan, resumption of service after an incident and adequacy of messages broadcast throughout the network.\nThe start of the dry run is not a confirmation of the commissioning date which is expected to be announced after all these trials are successfully completed.\nIn order to bring the REM into service, four out of five crucial milestones have already been achieved or are in progress including the simulated operation, completion of electrification work, test area extended to Montreal, the dry run and commissioning.\nOnce the date has been confirmed, the inauguration of the line from Brossard to Gare Centrale stations will be scheduled. This section is 16.6 km long served by five stations which when becoming operational, it will provide services 7 days a week, 20 hours a day.\nRéseau express métropolitain (REM) is a new 67 km automated metro system with 26 stations in Greater Montreal linking city’s downtown, the South Shore, the West Island, the North Shore and Montreal-Trudeau airport.

Local railroad personnel did not have a schematic of the electronic circuit, which resulted in a faulty connection in the signal system when they attempted to take the barrier circuit out of service to repair it, the report states. As a result of their intervention, the system routed the passenger train onto the line where the freight train was, according to the report.\nFrom the outset, investigators focused on the rail barrier repair work and its possible connection to a manual signal system diversion. The Indian Railways, the world’s fourth largest rail network, is a state monopoly administered by the Railway Board. The Board is subordinate to the Ministry of Railways.\nThe rail accident in India on 2 June killed nearly 300 people\nThe 2 June accident at Bahanaga Bazar station in the eastern Indian state of Odisha killed 288 people and injured more than 1,000. The disaster occurred when a passenger train hit a stationary freight train, jumped off the tracks and hit another oncoming passenger train.\nThe rail network is undergoing a $30 billion upgrade with new trains and modern stations as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to boost infrastructure and connectivity, but the accident has raised questions about whether safety has received enough attention.

The money invested here will create secure and highly qualified jobs as part of a sustainable, climate-friendly transport system. We look forward to seeing Grossräschen do its bit to advance green rail freight in Europe in the future,” the Infrastructure Minister said at the ground-breaking ceremony.\nThe 1,700-m2 facility is due to go into service in early 2024. It will have the capacity to handle around 2,000 freight wagons per year, making the company more independent of external repair shop services.\nThe project involves building a new workshop with adjacent office and warehouse space on the 65,000-m2 site, which boasts around 10 km of sidings. In the future, a modern, app-based shopfloor management system will be introduced for the workshop’s administrative processes. The aim of this system is to optimise the value chain by adopting more accurate, just-in-time delivery to the workshop, thereby boosting productivity in a smaller space. Only in this way can investments in the future of rail freight pay for themselves. Work in Grossräschen will focus on intermodal wagons, covering everything from the repair of typical damage to major revisions. The local team will also be able to inspect tank cars and provide mobile maintenance service.\nThe entire complex will operate on a carbon-neutral basis. Thermal heat pumps will be installed, and most of the electricity needed will be generated by the workshop’s own PV installations. Beyond that, only green electricity will be sourced to run the facility. An electric marshaling engine will be deployed to move wagons around the workshop area.\nThe project will create around 40 new jobs in Grossräschen, with the company looking for people such as fitters, welders, warehouse operatives, quality assurance staff and marshaling staff.\nThe carbon-neutral maintenance workshop is at VTG’s core element to implement its sustainable strategy which supports the company to become climate-neutral by 2040.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(231,'Railway PRO','Honolulu autonomous metro line inaugurated','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/honolulu-autonomous-metro-line-inaugurated/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Honolulu-Mayor-326x245.jpg','July 4, 2023','2023-09-20 16:53:58','Passenger service on the first section of Honolulu Skyline, the first fully autonomous metro in US, was inaugurated on June 30.\nThe opening ceremony which took place at the Hālawa station was attended by the Mayor of Honolulu, Rick Blangiardi, the Governor of Hawaii, Josh Green, the Director of City’s Department of Transportation Services, Roger Morton, the U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, and Alistair Dormer, Executive Vice President of Energy and Mobility at Hitachi as well as a number of other dignitaries. 250 people attended the opening ceremony and have also took the inaugural train ride through the nine stations.\nThe western elevated section is 17 km long (10.75 miles) with nine stations connecting East Kapolei at Kualaka`I station and Aloha Stadium, at Hālawa station.

Scottish Rail Holdings (SRH) will be focused on maintaining our current high standards of service through the transition. In due course, the Scottish Government Ministers and Scottish Rail Holdings (SRH), in partnership with Caledonian Sleeper Limited, will set out their aspirations for Caledonian Sleeper’s evolution.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(237,'Railway PRO','CPK: design, buy-ups, and construction.

Hundreds of bidders and contractors. Numerous contracts and framework agreements. Centralny Port Komunikacyjny performs contracts allowing the necessary studies and boreholes to be carried out while the design plans, specifications and feasibility studies are still being prepared, while the fieldwork is already underway.\n \nThe programme to buy up property for CPK, for which more than 1,250 owners have already signed up involving a total area of 3,500 hectares, is progressing so quickly that large-scale demolitions are already underway in the airport and railway junction. The company has brought in a contractor for a further dozen properties, and if we add the work completed, in progress and planned for the future for which there is already a contractor, this adds up to around 250 buildings on almost 70 properties.\nDrilling geological boreholes have been carried out since last year and are going to include several hundred locations. There have already been over 30 removals financed by CPK for owners who have sold their properties for the needs of CPK, and more are being organised. At the same time, work on feasibility studies, designs and field surveys is well underway. Each of these tasks results from signed contracts and purchasing procedures.\n“The scale of these tasks is possible thanks to the effective purchasing procedures and professional team. We are carrying out a huge investment task while maintaining a competitive environment under the requirements of public procurement law and following the guidelines of the European Commission,” says Marcin Jędrasik, PhD, Procurement Department Director at CPK. “Public procurement is the vehicle through which this strategic investment is implemented.”\n \nVia Hong Kong and Doha to Warsaw\nThe most spectacular design task concerns the passenger terminal and the railway station integrated with it. CPK is in the process of receiving and agreeing on the conceptual plans. This is all the result of works under the contract signed in November 2022 with Foster+Partners and Buro Happold, a British consortium with experience in designing airports in Hong Kong and Doha. This entity is the master architect.\nAt the same time and in close coordination with the work of the master architect, the design is underway for the runways and taxiways, aprons, railway tunnels, airport systems, networks and connections, together with engineering facilities. This is the task of the master civil engineer, a role that was assigned to Dar Al-Handasah, a Lebanese-American company, in the tender.\nThis is by no means the end of the design puzzle. The Spanish company, IDOM, won a tender at the end of last year for the airport systems integration designer. This entity is responsible for implementing and integrating the airport’s communication systems and specialised networks, which is the airport’s nervous system in simple and figurative terms.\nCPK has also signed two framework agreements with a total of 28 companies – including many Polish ones – for the design of the support facilities, such as the airport’s operations centre, buildings for rescue and firefighting services, as well as car parks, offices and hotels in the immediate vicinity of the airport. As part of this contract, a tender is underway for the design of an air traffic control tower which could be up to 105 metres tall. In comparison, the tallest tower in Poland today is located at Katowice airport, at 46 metres.\n \n\n \nNow for the railway. A record-breaking contract\nConsistently, CPK has also been step-by-step preparing the construction of the new High-Speed Railway lines. The routes have already been consulted and mapped already for a total of more than 600 km. The investment priority and most advanced investment is the 140 km section between Warsaw and Łódź, which should be available at the same time as the completion of the first stage of the airport (the other lines are planned in schedules in subsequent years).\nIt is for this priority section that the procedure for obtaining an environmental decision is well advanced. All the relevant design work is also underway. For implementation purposes, the Warsaw – Łódź section is divided into two parts. For the first of these (from Warsaw to the area behind the planned CPK junction), the documentation is being prepared by Biuro Projektów “Metroprojekt” and SUD Architekt Polska, while for the second (up to Łódź) is being prepared by the consortium of Egis Poland, Egis Rail and Jaf-Geotechnika. At the same time, an extension of this route is being designed for the section between Łódź and Wrocław. In this case, there are five contractors and work started a few months later.\nThere are so many CPK railway project tasks that the company commissions them under an eight-year framework agreement with 11 companies and consortia. This is currently the largest design work contract of its kind in Europe: its maximum total value is approximately PLN 7 billion net. The final amount depends on the number of bids submitted, so it may be lower.\nWhen CPK selects the companies with which it signs framework agreements, the experience and qualifications of the experts are key criteria. Each task’s contractor is selected from among the qualified companies based on price.\nWhere did the idea for a framework agreement come from in the first place? This model of working with designers demands the contracting authority in the initial phase, but then benefits both parties. For the investor, the framework agreement greatly speeds up the process of selecting contractors by reducing the formal obstacles. In turn, for contractors qualified as proven companies with experience, facilities and capacity it represents a likely portfolio for orders in the long term. The interest of contractors in this type of tender is enormous.\n“We are looking for flexibility in public procurement. The PPL Act indicates that framework agreements can be concluded for up to eight years, using objective principles and criteria specified in the contract documents. We have already signed 16 framework agreements, 6 more are in progress and even more are in the pipeline. A wide range of contractors are invited to contract: 8, 15, 20 and even 30. It is also important that the use of this mechanism does not limit the rights of contractors to legal remedies, i.e., possible appeals,” says Marcin Jędrasik.\nUnder the same formula, tenders are also underway for contractors to carry out preparatory construction work for the Warsaw-Łódź and Łódź-Wrocław railway sections: demolition and felling as well as geological and archaeological work. For these tasks, CPK is going to sign framework agreements with a total of 75 contractors. Similarly, contractors for construction preparation works are already selected for the airport area. The schedule assumes that the first stage of this investment is going to be operational in 2028.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(238,'Railway PRO','Romania’s capital to buy 250 more new trams','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/romanias-capital-to-buy-250-more-new-trams/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bucharest-STB-326x245.jpg','June 30, 2023','2023-09-20 16:54:33','The General Council of Bucharest (Romania) voted on Thursday on an opportunity study for 250 new trams in Bucharest.

Deutsche Bahn is therefore subject to abuse control under competition law and has to fulfil special obligations towards rival platforms,” Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt said.\nMobility platforms offer their customers comparative information on itineraries involving different means of transport and transport operators as well as the option of integrated ticketing. In this context, rail transport and the transport services offered by DB play an important role. For example, mobility platforms allow passengers to combine train tickets with flights, carsharing, long-distance coach services or rental bikes.\nDeutsche Bahn is not only a dominant rail operator, but it is also a strong mobility platform itself with its online portal bahn.de and its app DB Navigator. According to the Bundeskartellamt’s findings, DB uses its key position on the transport and infrastructure markets to restrict competition from third-party mobility platforms.\nIn the authority’s view, DB’s clauses on advertising bans, vertical price specifications, far-reaching bans on discounts and the withholding of a commission for carrying out the payment process are anti-competitive. Following DB’s announcement made in the meantime that it no longer intended to pay mobility platforms an intermediary commission for arranging the ticket sales, the obligation to pay such a commission in accordance with antitrust compensation standards was also raised in the proceeding.\nBundeskartellamt says that in addition, DB is denying mobility platforms continuous and non-discriminatory real-time access to all the traffic data controlled by itself which are essential for organising and booking journeys including different means of transport. This includes delay data for passenger rail services as well as data on train cancellations or cancelled or additional stops, the reasons for delays or cancellations, additional runs or replacement transport services, up-to-date information on platforms or platform changes and data on major disruptions.\nThe new EU rail passenger rights regulation, which has been in force since 7 June 2023, requires DB to share forecast data for the purpose of informing passengers. However, in the Bundeskartellamt’s view, this is not sufficient to end the violation of competition law. The EU rail passenger rights regulation does not cover all the necessary real-time data, nor does it regulate important commercial and technical aspects of implementing data access.\nNegotiations have been held and an agreement couldn’t be reached due to individual commercial requirements. “Consequently, to prevent possible practices of Deutsche Bahn favouring its own offers or providing less favourable conditions regarding access to forecast data, an official decision ordering Deutsche Bahn to stop engaging in such practices is needed,” Andreas Mundt explained.\nThe President of Bundeskartellamt says that the rail incumbent Deutsche Bahn has to change several contractual clauses which may put some rectrictions on competition at expense of rival mobility platforms. “We want to prevent Deutsche Bahn from expanding its dominance in passenger rail transport also to future mobility markets and from holding back innovative mobility service providers in favour of its own business interests,” he said.\nTo improve the situation, the institution has imposed rail incumbent Deutsche Bahn four rules including:\n\nmobility platforms will be able to use DB-specific terms for online and app-store advertising without any contractual restrictions imposed by DB;\nDB’s online partners will be able to use their own discount campaigns, bonus points or cashback programmes when selling DB tickets.  This puts an end to the unequal treatment between third-party mobility platforms and DB itself, which in turn uses these means to advertise its own services;\nDB will have to compensate mobility service providers based on minimum competition-law standards for carrying out the booking and payment processes on behalf of DB when selling train tickets. The same applies to the intermediary commission itself; and\nThe rules under the new EU passenger rights regulation regarding the provision of real-time data will be supplemented, the implementation of the commercial and technical requirements in particular will be further regulated by way of specifications and data access will be made available also with regard to real-time data of third-party rail operators. Third-party access to data has to be non-discriminatory and comparable with DB’s own access to data.\n\nThe decision to end the competition-law violation is dynamic in order to stimulate competition for smart mobility services even more than has so far been the case. In view of the constitutionally protected freedoms enjoyed by companies, the Bundeskartellamt leaves it to the contractual partners themselves to agree on the contractual details and arrange the specific contractual conditions. Negotiations will be accompanied by a system of deadlines.\nDB to appeal the decision\nDeutsche Bahn has announced that is rejecting the decision of Bundeskartellamt ans plans to appeal it. The decision which would require DB to make numerous changes to its sales model. The proceedings stemmed from complaints brought by several international online sales platforms.\nThe issue originally focused on the sharing of real-time data, including, for example, the forecast arrival and departure times of ICE and Intercity trains. DB made it clear early on that it would share its real-time data with its distribution partners starting June 7 as part of a Europe-wide package to improve passenger rights.\nThe rail company says that the Bundeskartellamt decision “goes far beyond the original demands and would force DB to remunerate online platforms for the sale of DB tickets, even if this does not offer any added value for DB due to DB’s own very well-developed sales channels.”\nThe online platforms are often backed by well-funded major U.S. banks, international asset management companies and funds. In addition, the decision would also force DB to release its trademarked terms and sales channel designations such as “DB Navigator” and “bahn.de” for search engine marketing of the online platforms. As a result, customers searching for the term “bahn.de,” for example, may end up on the page of an online platform. This allows the platforms to steer customers away from DB channels to their own channels.\nThe rail incumbent Deutsche Bahn says also that the decision of the Federal Cartel Office has also huge financial consequences due to the required changes of the sales model and they will not be compensated by corresponding savings or additional revenues. With its smart mobility platforms “DB itself has high-performing and effective sales platforms which it wishes to invest in and expand. The decision will place additional financial burdens on DB, which in the worst case will lead to higher ticket prices and lower investment,” DB explains.\nOn the other hand, AllRail, the Alliance of Passenger Rail New Entrants in Europe, says that the deiscion of the Federal Cartel Office is a strong signal for a major rail reform in Europe and calls the ruling to be applied to all rail operators in Europe who use monopolistic behaviour. “The EU and Member States need to finally break cartels such as DB in order to enable more competition, digitalisation and innovation for consumers, and a real chance to reduce the high carbon emissions from transport,” the association highlights.\n“Anti-competitive behaviour is not allowed, and Europe must act on this momentum to distribute the power away from dominant rail incumbents – like DB – in order to ensure it is shared by smaller existing companies and future start-ups who want a fair chance when entering the market,” AllRail Secretary General Nick Brooks said.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(241,'Railway PRO','Renfe orders additional EMUs from CAF','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/renfe-orders-additional-emus-from-caf/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renfe-326x245.jpg','June 29, 2023','2023-09-20 16:54:50','The Board of Directors of Renfe has confirmed its decision to make use of the option to extend the amount of medium-distance electric units provided for in the contract which was awarded to CAF at the end of 2022.\nFollowing this decision, Renfe exercised an option to order 32 additional trainsets of which 24 will be 3-car trains and the other 8 trains will be 4-car units. EUR 190 million is the value of this option.\nThe trains to be supplied by CAF will have similar specifications to those previously ordered and are currently in the manufacturing process. They will be able to operate at 200 km/h. One of the stand-out features of the unit is its capacity to run short distances autonomously on sections of the network where there is no catenary or when required when a power cut occurs, on account of the batteries the units are equipped with. CAF’s incorporation of this technology on a number of its latest projects is testament of its commitment to developing this zero-emission solution to address passenger transport decarbonisation. The company is working in this area both by developing the vehicles themselves to make them more efficient and lighter, and by improving operation, with a view towards achieving optimum integration between vehicles and infrastructure.\nThe initial contract, awarded to CAF in October last year, established the initial supply of 28 medium-distance electric units, together with the supply of their relevant depot parts and train maintenance services for 15 years. This agreement includes further options to extend the scope in the future. One of these was the production of up to 42 additional trains and it is part of this option that Renfe has now enforced. Following this latest order, Renfe will acquire 60 medium-distance electric units increasing transport capacity and passenger comfort.\nThis purchase complements the acquisition of the 29 Cercanías units, also awarded to CAF in March 2022 in order to guarantee maximum efficiency in the operation of the new fleet and the lowest cost over a long period of time.\nIn addition, in 2021, Renfe has signed EUR 2.44 billion contracts with Alstom and Stadler to acquire 211 high-capacity trains of which 152 Alstom’s Coradia Stream trains for Cercanías network and 59 high-capacity trains for commuter services manufactured by Stadler. In December, the Spanish operator ordered from Alstom 49 additional trains bringing the high-capacity train fleet manufactured by Alstom to 20 trains. In June, Alstom and the Spain’s Minister of Transport and Mobility have unveiled the design of the new Coradia Stream train for Renfe.\nRenfe Mercancías announced in January that it will invest EUR 122.7 million to renew its freight rolling stock including the procurement of 12 electric locomotives from Stadler, as well as new platforms and wagons which will be also equipped with latest technologies to increase capacity, performance and energy efficiency.\nRenfe plans to renew its rolling stock fleet by investing more than EUR 4.5 billion for the procurement of 436 new trains, and 50 new locomotives as well to modernise 57 existing trains designed to operate the high-speed, Cercanías, and metric gauge networks.\nWhen adding the maintenance of this rolling stock fleet, the global investment reaches over EUR 5.2 billion.\nAt the beginning of 2023, the Spanish Official Credit Institute (ICO) and Renfe signed a EUR 350 million agreement to support the procurement of the ordered Cercanías high-capacity trains. For this operation, ICO has obtained funds from the European Investment Bank for the same amount. In the spring of 2020, the bank has approved a EUR 320 million loan for Renfe’s new rolling stock.\nThe new trains will allow the rejuvenation of the fleet, with the consequent increase in reliability and the reduction of incidents. The new trains will increase energy efficiency and will be adapted to the obligations of implementation of accessibility. A part of the new trains will replace the diesel fleet thus reducing CO2 emissions.In 2026, the company will have the most modern fleet in Europe and in addition, this will mean the creation of 52,000 jobs.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(242,'Railway PRO','Stadler delivers hydrogen trains to Sardinia, Italy','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/stadler-delivers-hydrogen-trains-to-sardinia-italy/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stadler-hydrogen-train-326x245.jpg','June 29, 2023','2023-09-20 16:54:54','ARST, the regional transport company in Sardinia, Italy, has recently awarded the tender for the supply of the first 6 hydrogen trains for the new rail connections between Alghero and Sassari/Sorso and the Alghero-Fertilia “Riviera del Corallo” airport.\n\nThis is a fundamental step in the energy transition process promoted by the Region of Sardinia and implemented by ARST, with the aim of progressively “decarbonising” local public transport on the island, in line with the environmental objectives set at European and national level.

The two sections were operated by only freight trains and after the completion, passenger trains can use the connection.\nAfter the modernisation and construction works, passenger trains on Gdynia – Kościerzyna rail section will rut at up to 140 km/h and freight trainbs, at up to 100 km/h.\nThe Polish rail infrastructure manager PKP PLK is improving the rail access to the seaports of Gdańsk and Gdynia and is modernising the main transport corridors and expanding the logistics possibilities of the corridors including on the north-south axis, such as Rail Carpatia.\nAs the result of the wider project, up to 750-metre-long heavier freight trains with an axle load of with an axle load of 22.5 tonnes reach the quays, which can carry more cargoes. Investments ensure efficient and safe delivery and collection of more goods by rail, the most ecological means of transport, which translates into a reduction in the number of trucks on the roads.\nIn 2022, construction works were completed to improve rail access to the port of Gdańsk.\nAlmost 70 km of tracks and 221 turnouts were reconstructed. A new traction network and a modern computerised railway traffic control system were built.\nIn February 2023, the rail infrastructure manager completed the new 600-metre-long viaduct allowing freight train operation on a single track in Gdynia Port station\n. Works are on schedule to complete the construction of the second track. In total, the viaduct will have four tracks. Works on another 140m viaduct were also completed. The new viaducts will have been designed allow heavier and longer trains (750m) with a 22.5-tonne-axle load improving the capacity of lines leading to the port.\nPKP PLK expects to complete the project to increase Gdynia port rail connection and capacity, inthe fourth quarter of this year. So far, 107 km of new tracks, out of 115 km, and 293 turnouts, out of 332 as well as 23 intersections have been built.Since March 2022, train traffic to the port has been conducted from the Gdynia Port local control centre, supported by two new signal boxes.Compared to 2015, the capacity at the Gdańsk Port station is expected to increase more than threefold, and at the Gdynia Port station to increase twice.\nThe investment to Gdynia port is carried out under the “Improvement of railway access to the seaport in Gdynia” project with a total value of PLN 1.6 billion (EUR 361 million) and 45% is covered by the European Union through the Connecting Europe Facility. Under the 2015 CEF call, PKP PLK obtained EUR 162.2 million co-financing out of the eligible costs of EUR 190.8 million.\nThe “Improving rail access to the port of Gdansk”, a EUR 108.5 million CEF grant was provided out of the eligible costs of EUR 132.7 million. the project has been completed at the end of 2022.\nThe investments for the rail projects at the two ports have a value of about PLN 3 billion (EUR 676.7 million) and are important from the point of view of the entire national economy.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(246,'Railway PRO','ASFR-ERA cooperation agreement for the Technical Pillar of the Railway Package IV','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/asfr-era-cooperation-agreement/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Josef-Doppelbauer-Petru-Bogdan-326x245.jpg','June 28, 2023','2023-09-20 16:55:12','An ASFR-ERA cooperation agreement for Romania’s compliance with the Technical Pillar of the Railway Package IV was signed on Tuesday in Lille, France.\nThe agreement was signed by the Director General of the Romanian Railway Safety Authority – ASFR, Petru Bogdan, and the Executive Director of the European Railway Agency (ERA), Josef Doppelbauer.\n\nCooperation Agreement with the Romanian #Railway #Safety Authority ASFR signed today in @LilleFrance.\nLooking forward to excellent cooperation, as together we are stronger, ready to create opportunities for rail.\n@mtransporturi #rail #memorandum pic.twitter.com/0nvKyr2Nox\n— Josef Doppelbauer (@JoDoppelbauer) June 27, 2023\n\n“We are looking forward to excellent cooperation, because together we are stronger, ready to create opportunities for rail transport,” Josef Doppelbauer wrote on his Twitter account.

While Hitachi Rail already uses diesel-electric hybrid technology, pioneered on the UK’s Intercity Express fleets, this is the first time batteries have been deployed as a major power source on a train fleet for commercial use anywhere in Europe. The ability to recharge while in service using the pantograph or traction motors means it can deliver seamless green journeys without cutting availability.\nOffering more sustainable rail travel, and with compatibility with other European railways, the tribrid train reduces carbon emissions and fuel consumption by 50% vs standard diesel trains. By running on battery power when traveling through non-electrified urban areas, the train can eliminate emissions, including harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx), while also reducing noise pollution.\nThe Masaccio train’s DAS (Driver Advisory System) also helps cut emissions by identifying the optimal speed for timetable reliability and the reduction of energy consumption. In a further boost for sustainability, Masaccio trains are made with 93% recyclable materials.\nFor Italy’s, as well as Europe’s non-electrified lines, the Masaccio trains offer an immediate solution to help decarbonise European passenger rail transport. In Italy there are more than 4,000 km of track that are not electrified, with more than 10,000 of km n across Europe.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe long-term case for battery trains is especially strong on branch lines or in areas where geographical or topological features make electrification very hard to achieve. The battery power provides the Masaccio trains with added power and acceleration to tackle tough gradients, while the flexibility of the design allows the interior customisation to suit everything from high density commuter journeys to offering more space for leisure equipment, like snowboards or mountain bikes.\n“The roll-out of our cutting-edge Masaccio battery train marks an important step in our efforts to decarbonise European rail. With around 40% of regional lines across the continent remaining un-electrified, battery hybrid technology can have an immediate impact,” Luca D’Aquila, CEO of Hitachi Rail Italy, said.\nIn Italy, the tribrid train is helping cut carbon emissions by 50% compared to existing diesel services. The Masaccio train has been unveiled at InnoTransport 2022 in Berlin and has been designed to be suitable for railways across Europe. The trains are built at a Europe-wide gauge and with ERTMS digital signalling included onboard as standard.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(248,'Railway PRO','Arriva wins extension contract for London Overground','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/arriva-wins-extension-contract-for-london-overground/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/London-Overground1-326x245.jpg','June 27, 2023','2023-09-20 16:55:24','Arriva Group’s train operating company, Arriva Rail London (ARL) was granted a two-year extension contract as the delivery partner for the London Overground concession, which is operated with Transport for London.\nArriva has operated the London Overground network since November 2016 and following the contract extension, is expected to do so up to May 2026.\nThe new contract comes into effect in May 2024 and will see ARL building on its track record of maintaining some of the highest levels of performance in the country as TfL’s delivery partner, while increasing its passenger numbers.\nThe announcement brings continuity for 430,000 passengers who use ARL’s trains every day and builds on Arriva’s record of delivering improvements for London Overground customers, working in partnership with TfL to provide more frequent services, new trains and improved interchanges.\nThe contract extension is also good news for ARL’s 1,500 employees who serve Londoners and see themselves as part of the community.\nARL successfully supported TfL during Covid and London Overground has now recovered to 88% of pre-pandemic passenger journeys. During the term of ARL’s contract, the operator has also implemented a number of service improvements, such as the 4.5 km extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside route and the introduction of four-car trains, which doubled the line’s capacity.\n“There has been a great deal of change, not only at London Overground but in the rail industry, since the pandemic but ARL, supported by TfL, has risen to the challenge as we adapt to changing customer travelling habits.

This means that the new funds will now cover 50 percent of all project costs. The remaining costs are shared equally between Italy and Austria.\nThe European co-financing refers to the continuation of civil works activities to achieve the Brenner Base Tunnel, meaning in particular the excavation of the main tunnels and multi-functional stations, the completion of the exploratory tunnel and the preparation and construction of the supporting technical infrastructure. It also includes the continuation of activities concerning the design and preparation and execution of tenders, obtaining the necessary authorisations, geognostic and exploratory surveys, monitoring and compensatory measures as well as the development of design activities, preparatory to the construction of the railway equipment for the tunnel. The project will contribute to the timely completion of the Brenner Base Tunnel, which is part of the Scandinavian-Mediterranean Corridor.\n“The two board members of the binational project company BBT SE, Martin Gradnitzer and Gilberto Cardola, see it as a great sign of confidence that the EU will once again provide a high funding contribution,” says BBT SE, the company responsible for the implementation of the Brenner Base Tunnel project.\nAfter a comprehensive analysis, BBT SE has estimated the total project costs for the Brenner Base Tunnel at around EUR 10.5 billion. The breakdown of the estimated total costs includes EUR 8.54 billion for construction works, more than EUR 1 billion for risk provision and EUR 903 million which covers the preliminary monetary adjustment, meaning the probable inflation applicable to future costs.\nThe adjustment of the original total cost estimate of EUR 9.6 billion according to the Austrian calculation method and EUR 8.8 billion according to the Italian calculation method is mainly due to inflation trends such as price increases in the energy sector and cost inflation of building materials. The present total cost estimate was calculated on the basis of a joint Austrian – Italian inflation rate specifically for the BBT project, thus the current amount is therefore the product of a single, joint cost estimate.\nThe Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT) connecting Austria and Italy runs for 64 km between Tulfes/Innsbruck and Fortezza, making it the longest underground railway stretch in the word. The BBT ends in Innsbruck in the existing railway bypass tunnel, which ends in Tulfes. A new rescue tunnel is being built running parallel to the bypass. The two-tube tunnel system between Innsbruck and Fortezza is 55 km long.\nIn the spring of 2023, the first TBM excavating one of the main tunnels in the eastern main tunnel in Italy has reached the Brenner after 4 years of activity. The works were carried out on the H61 Mules 2-3 section, the largest lot of the entire Brenner Base Tunnel project and comprises a tunnel system of approximately 65 km.\nIn April 2023, BBT SE awarded the consortium of Porr Bau GmbH, Marti GmbH Austria and Marti Tunnel AG Switzerland the contract for the construction of H53 Pfons-Brenner lot. EUR 959 million is the contract’s value and represents the largest construction lot on Austrian project territory. The contract comprises the construction of 25.2 km of main tunnels which will be driven between the municipal area of Pfons and the national border at the Brenner Pass. The scheduled construction time for this tunnel section is 70.5 months (5.8 years). With this award decision, all tunnel construction lots of the Brenner Base Tunnel project have now been awarded.\nIn May 2023, the tunnel boring machine “Lilia” started the excavation works for 8.1 km of the east main tunnel from Ahrental southwards on the H41 Sill Gorge-Pfons section. The tubbing rings for the H41 Sill Gorge-Pfons construction lot are produced in the new, specially constructed plant directly on the existing construction site. In the next 2.5 years, a total of about 51,000 tubbing rings will be produced specifically for this construction lot.

Our team has shown its relentless ability to navigate and overcome challenges to bring us where we are today. We have built something remarkable, and I am excited to see millions of people ride brighter,” the CEO of Brightline said.\nThe two phases of Brightline construction generated more than 10,000 jobs and more than USD 6.4 billion in economic impact to the state of Florida. The construction teams worked more than 7 million hours battling through the pandemic and supply chain shortages to finish the 273.5 km (170 miles) corridor extension.\nWork on Orlando rail extension started in June 2019 one year after operations began in South Florida between Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach stations. Additional stations were opened in downtown Boca Raton and Aventura in 2022 as construction to Orlando continued. Brightline is the first U.S. private entity to deliver an intercity rail system.\nBrightline is continuing critical high speed train testing throughout the corridor between West Palm Beach and Orlando and will test up to 110 mph through Brevard County in July. In addition to testing, Brightline recently completed its final rail and track cutover on the 170-mile project, which integrates a new second track into the existing corridor. Once testing is complete, Brightline will conduct crew certification and revenue service demonstration.\nBrightline’s Orlando extension project is divided into four sub-projects, which includes a state-of-the-art 62-acre train maintenance facility in south of Orlando International Airport, tenant buildout of the Orlando station at Orlando International Airport, 56 bridges, three underpasses and upgrades to 156 rail crossings.\nThe second subproject covers a 5.6 km (3.5 mile) double-track section at Orlando International Airport including six bridges, two underpasses and several airport improvements, including a new traffic interchange configuration and the airport’s first roundabout designed to assist with traffic flow.\nThe 56 km (35 miles) line follows the Beachline Expressway/SR 528 corridor between Orlando International Airport and Cocoa. 18 new bridges, three underpasses, drainage installations, track and signalling installation and 96.5 km tracks (60 miles) of new rail will be constructed.\nThe last section of the project covers a 207.6 km (129 miles) corridor of existing track between Cocoa and West Palm Beach that was upgraded from Class IV to VI allowing increased speeds of up to 110 mph and included a second main track built parallel to the existing track. Work includes the shift of 90 km (56 miles) of existing track, construction of 161 km (100 miles) of new Class VI track within the existing right of way, rehabilitation of 45 km (28 miles) of existing sidings, the installation or relocation of approximately 80 turnouts and crossovers, relocation of fiber duct parallel to the ROW, and upgrades and added improvements to 156 rail crossings. Work also included replacement of 19 bridges including two movable bridges, the replacement of the Loxahatchee River Bridge and the rehabilitation of the St. Lucie River Bridge.\nIn March 2023, Brightline became the fastest train in Florida and the Southeastern United States after reaching speeds of 130 mph.

To request aid for traffic carried out throughout 2023, rail freight operators must submit the documentation electronically from January 1 and end on April 1, 2024.\nThe budget assigned to the 2023 call has initially increased by EUR 5 million, compared to preliminary estimations, following the increase in European funds allocated to the railway eco-incentive programme and the improvement of the bases to adapt the aid to the economic situation marked by the rise in energy prices, problems in supply chains and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\nThe call is part of the eco-incentive programme under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and is aimed at subsidising rail freight traffic carried out between January 1 and December 31, 2023, which meets the conditions of an order published in December 2022.  The document resulted in an increase of EUR 15 million to the total budget of the programme which initially included EUR 60 million from European NextGenerationEU funds to promote Spanish rail freight transport. The extra funds come from the aid programme for companies in a competitive competition for sustainable and digital transport.\nIt is expected that in 2024 another call will be approved with an amount that could be increased, foreseeably, by up to EUR 25 million euros.\nFor the first call, ended in March, which subsidises freight traffic carried out between April 30 and December 31, 2022, nine applications have been submitted currently under assessing phase.\nIn March 2022, the European Commission has approved, under the EUR Stated aid rules, a EUR 120 million scheme for Spanish rail freight transport through the Recovery and Resilience Facility to support road traffic to be shift towards railways. This scheme, which will run until 30 June 2026, is aimed at promoting rail as a more environmentally friendly mean of transport, as well as at contributing to the greening of rail transport.\nThis support will take the form of direct grants to compensate rail freight operators for the cost difference between road and rail transport based on the actual volumes of freight shifted from road to rail transport. The aid amount is also calculated based on the environmental performance of the rail companies, which incentivises performance improvements. The scheme is open to all freight companies established in the European Union and possessing all the necessary licences and the maximum amount of aid per beneficiary depends on the modal shift achieved.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nMitma says that a company may opt for more or less aid depending on the growth of its activity, the type of traction of the locomotives and the occupation of the freight wagons. Operators will be able to take advantage of the subsidies to, for example, reduce rates or improve the quality of services, which will result in tangible benefits for shippers and the rest of the multimodal chain. The companies will receive the subsidies if, during 2023, they register a traffic greater than or equal to the average of the traffic carried out during the same period of the two previous years, and an occupation or efficiency of more than 20%, among other requirements.\nAny type of traffic – intermodal, automotive, etc. – with the exception of coal, is considered eligible. The greater the reduction in external environmental and socio-economic costs, the greater the aid that will be received. In this way, greater aid will be given to electric traction than to diesel and a higher degree of occupancy of freight wagons will prevail. Including several requirements, Mitma says that the annual amount of the subsidy must be less than 30% of the total cost of rail transport.\nThe financing of initiatives will help Spanish rail freight transport to win the battle with road transport as the authorities support the rails’ environmental performance activity which also helps to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels.\nThe railway eco-incentive programme is based on triple objectives aiming at strengthening and increasing rail modal share within the multimodal chains as an alternative in the transport of goods, at increasing rail operators’ traffic to deliver more attractive services in the benefit of their customers and at improving their environmental performance by encouraging the prioritization of the use of electric traction systems and improving efficiency.\nAdif plans to increase freight transport\nAt the beginning of June, Adif has presented a report on its guidelines to effectively increase rail freight transport with actions that mobilise an investment of more than EUR 1 billion since 2018.\nThe company undertakes 26 actions in different strategic axes, such as for ROLA services, intermodal logistics nodes, the deployment of modern and digital systems and connections with port infrastructures as part of the programme to develop the Atlantic and Mediterranean trans-European corridors.\nAll of the actions performed by Adif are aimed at improving productivity and network management and increasing competitiveness with significant savings in external costs and GHG emissions. These measures will attract a greater number of companies to this mode of transport, advancing towards more sustainable and competitive mobility included in an efficient multimodal network.\nAdif is working on different rail connections to support ROLA services with high demand. The rail infrastructure manager is working on the connection between Algeciras and Zaragoza to adapt the gauge and overpasses to the requirements of such services. The Madrid – Valencia is another project adif is working and is expected to be completed in 2024 and recently has signed a contract for Seville – Madrid and Huelva – Madrid axes. These two routes the company is analising options to extend them towards Zaragoza.\nOn June 7, Adif the Seville Port Authority (APS), Grupo Pantoja (GP) and Rail&Truck Strait Union (R&T) signed a collaboration agreement to initiate ROLA services on the Seville – Córdoba – Madrid corridor. under the agreement, an economic and management feasibility will be elaborated to develop the rail infrastructure and intermodal terminals as well as to adapt the rolling stock. The route will connect the Terminal Marítima del Guadalquivir, located in the Port of Seville, with Madrid Abronigal rail terminal and the Madrid-Vicálvaro terminal where Adif is currently performing works to increase its capacity.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\n250 round trips per year are expected to be deployed on the Madrid – Seville route with 16,000 semi-trailers per year to be transported initially. The capacity is expected to increase to 32,000 each year. These services would initially capture 5% of the market and would reach to 10%.\nOn June 7, Adif has also signed an agreement with Port Authority of Huelva (APH) to develop ROLA services on Iberian gauge lines between Huelva and Madrid with a possible extension to Zaragoza promoting the transport of semi-trailers onto railways to shift road transport towards railways and decarbonise transport sector. The two companies will collaborate to manage and invest in projects aiming at developing an efficient operation on railways providing additional capacity, including in terminals, and to make available more specific rolling stock. Adif will carry out actions related to gauges in tunnels, overpasses, bridges, stations and electrification needed for semi-trailers (of P400 type) transport on pocket wagons.\nRenfe Mercancías will provide specialised wagons for semi-trailers loading on Iberian-gauge lines with an initial daily round-trip traffic between Huelva and Madrid. This service will be carried out using zero-emission electric locomotives. At the same time, the Port of Huelva will increase the capacity of the loading/unloading infrastructure according to Renfe Mercancías’ needs. In April 2023, Thales was awarded a contract to deliver and install new safety systems at rail terminals in the Port of Huelva.\nHuelva – Madrid – Zaragoza corridor is recording an high volume of road freight transport from or to the Port of Huelva mainly from the Canary Islands and other destinations, as well as internal production in the province of Huelva, with the consequent environmental impacts, noise and risks on road safety. An important part of this transport comes from the Ro-Ro services from the Motorways of the Sea which is likely to continue its journey by rail through ROLA services.\nThe investment in the logistics facilities exceeds EUR 493 million and Adif is advancing the development of its strategic network of intermodal nodes, mainly in Madrid (Vicálvaro terminal), Valencia (Fuente de San Luis terminal) in Alva (Júndiz terminal) as well as in Valladolid, Seville and Zaragoza. Actions are being carried out at these facilities to adapt them to the interoperability parameters and increase their capacity, advancing towards a model in which the intermodal terminal converges with the logistics zone and creates synergies. In these terminals, digital technology is essential for the automation of management processes and the provision of 5G connectivity which will facilitate the synchro-modality of the multimodal transport chain and the improvement of the operational processes. The development of the logistics terminals in Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona and Álava and the deployment of 5G technology will receive European funding through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).\nThis year, the strategic logistics nodes on the Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors benefit a EUR 1.6 billion investment from Adif and Adif AV for actions related to each corridor to promote intermodality, improve the efficiency and reliability of the network and its adaptation to European standards.\nTo boost freight traffic on these corridors, the expansion of sidings by up to 750 metres is key to accommodate longer trains for which EUR 80 million investments have been made.\nFor both Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors, more than EUR 424 million have been mobilised for the construction of railway accesses to ports to connect with the network of strategic nodes, the rest of the railway network, including the European corridors. Among the works in progress are implemented for the connections with the ports of Barcelona, Sagunto, Castellò, Seville and Bilbao to improve efficiency of the logistics chain and to increase Spanish rail freight transport. The authorities will invest EUR 8 billion to increase rail freight modal shift to 10% until 2030.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(255,'Railway PRO','T10 tram line inaugurated in Île-de-France','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/t10-tram-line-inaugurated-in-ile-de-france/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Paris-T10-tram-line-official-opening-326x245.jpg','June 26, 2023','2023-09-20 16:56:34','Île-de-France Mobilités opened the T10 tram line in Paris region connecting La Croix de Berny (Antony, in southern Paris) and Jardin Parisien station (Clamart, in southwestern Paris) in 21 minutes.\nThe 6.8 km with 13 station new tram line in the south of Hauts-de-Seine is the culmination of 6 years of work under project ownership by the Hauts-de-Seine Department, in charge of project management relating to urban integration and urban development, and Île-de-France Mobilités, in charge of project management for the transport system – including tram platform, stations, trains – the site’s workshop facility, as well as the acquisition of rolling stock.\nThe rolling stock maintenance and storage facility, designed by the AIA consortium, has been constructed in Châtenay-Malabry, located 11 km southwestern of Paris city centre. The workshop is distinguished by a design that fits perfectly into its environment, and by an important place given to technology. The facility has a 7,500 m2 maintenance hall, a service station with washing, greasing and sandblasting, and 7 storage lanes allowing the LRVs to be parked outside operating periods, make up this park of just over 3.5 hectares.\nThe new line is part of a programme to modernise the Île-de-France transport network. The line is operated by 13 Alstom Citadis X05 light rail vehicles, each 45 metres long has 73 seats including 9 seats reserved for people with reduced mobility, and is able to carry up to 314 passengers.\nThe delivery of the trams for Line T10 began in August 2022 and was completed in April 2023, on schedule. This new line can accommodate almost 25,000 passengers a day.\n“We are delighted to see the arrival today of the Citadis “lumière” tram on Line T10 and to offer a new, reliable, comfortable, elegant, and modern transport solution to the residents of Hauts-de-Seine,” Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, the President of Alstom France said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe tram has 8 double-leaf doors per side, as well as wider, illuminated intercirculations that facilitate traffic flow and increase the passenger exchange rate. An 85 linear metre luminous band surrounds the vehicle that changes light signals at the opening and closing of the doors and a luminous ring brings additional lighting in the gangways. In addition and a continuous white line illuminates when the tram is moving.\nThe tram has 45% glass surfaces, 100% LED lighting, 8 extra-large multimedia screens for the dynamic route planner, 32 USB sockets and bench seats. The integral low floor LRV offers increased level access throughout the tram and easy access for people with reduced mobility, particularly wheelchair users.\nThis tram is energy-efficient, thanks to improved energy consumption for traction and auxiliaries. The 100% LED lighting cuts the energy consumption by 25% and the conditioning system by 15%. The overall cost of preventive maintenance has been reduced by 18%, compared with the previous generation of Citadis X02 trams. In addition, the “lumière” tram is designed with materials that are 99% recyclable.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nIn November 2016, Alstom has been selected to design and supply the trams for lines T9 and T10. The first order covered the delivery of 22 Citadis trams for Line T9 and in May 2021, a further 13 trams were ordered for Line T10, bringing the total number of trams ordered for lines T9 and T10 to 35. Île-de-France Mobilités is financing the entire tram procurement. In addition, Alstom was also awarded a EUR 130 million contract to deliver Citadis X05 light rail vehicles to replace the existing fleet on the T1 line.\nThe 10 km tram Line T9 has been inaugurated in April 2026 and is operated by Keolis.\nThe tram has been designed by Alstom’s Advanced & Creative Design teams, Saguez & Partners and the Île-de-France Mobilités design teams, resulted in the sleek sleek “lumière” LRV.  It stands out by its elegant lines and is accentuated by a signature lighting that runs throughout the vehicle, inside and out, and which was chosen from three variants proposed by Île-de-France Mobilités to the people of Île-de-France during a public consultation.\nThe T10 tram line in Paris region running from Antony to Clamart, via Châtenay-Malabry and Le Plessis-Robinson provides a 100% electric public transport, the best alternative to car transport. Considering the impact on the environment, each station has been designed with their own identity, each equipped with aesthetic street furniture that promotes this proximity to the environment. In addition, the new line delivers a great opportunity to rejuvenate the urban landscape of southern Hauts-de-Seine, by setting up new traffic lanes, optimise cycle lanes and widen sidewalks for the comfort of all users.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(256,'Railway PRO','London-style ticketing system in Greater Manchester','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/london-style-ticketing-system-in-greater-manchester/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Grater-Manchester-public-transport-326x245.jpg','June 26, 2023','2023-09-20 16:56:42','The Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has confirmed the decision of Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) to create a single bus and tram ticketing system to cut cost of travel. The proposed route for the contactless pilot on rail in Greater Manchester is subject to final business case approval and funding.\nFirst announced as part of the city-region’s trailblazer devolution deal, TfGM has been working closely with Great British Railways Transition Team (GBRTT) and the Department for Transport (DfT) to develop the pilot on services between Stalybridge and Victoria, and Glossop and Piccadilly.\nThe three institutions will then work together to use the pilot to support the wider ambition of full multi-modal integration into the Bee Network across bus, Metrolink, rail and cycle hire, including fares simplification and capping, by 2030.\nFollowing this decision, a pilot contactless touch-in/touch-out project will be launched which will make Greater Manchester the first area outside London to implement such a project.\n“Cutting the cost of public transport benefits everyone and I want it to be a lasting and defining part of the Bee Network. That can only happen if more people use it, so my plea today is for everyone to get on board with us and help keep fares low,” Andy Burnham said, adding that the pilot project is a new way to pay rail journeys “that will ultimately enable us to integrate certain key rail services in Greater Manchester into the Bee Network.”\nAs part of the Bee Network, Greater Manchester is bringing buses back under local control in three phases, starting in Wigan, Bolton and parts of Salford and Bury, with services to be operated by Go North West and Diamond from 24 September 2023.\nThe second phase of franchising will take place in Rochdale, Oldham, Bury and parts of Manchester, Salford and Tameside from 24 March, with Stagecoach, First and Diamond announced as the operators appointed to run these services. As well as prioritising performance and reliability, bringing buses under local control is proving more efficient and effective than the current deregulated market, with franchised services costing less than those recently funded by TfGM after they were withdrawn by operators.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe new Bee AnyBus + Tram tickets, delivered by TfGM with support from Greater Manchester TravelCards Ltd (GMTL), will make combined bus and tram ticketing system will reduce travel costs by around 20 percent cheaper compared to buying products separately and will launch on 24 September when the city-region becomes the first area to begin to bring buses under local control for the first time in almost 40 years.\nIntegrating fares across different modes is key to enabling seamless journeys. Following the launch of the new Bee AnyBus + Tram tickets, TfGM will be working towards a touch-in/touch-out contactless system that will cap travel made across bus and tram, to be launched in early 2025 in line with the final phase of bus franchising.\nBought through the new Bee Network app and other retail channels, it means unlimited journeys on any bus service and any chosen Metrolink zone for as little as GBP 5.40 (EUR 6.3). Unlimited travel on all buses and the entire Metrolink network will cost GBP 7.80 (EUR 99.1) if travelling off-peak, or GBP 9.50 (EUR 11.1) at peak times. In comparison, the average cost of just parking a car in Manchester city centre is GBP 7 (EUR 8.2) for two hours and GBP 10.27 (EUR 12) for three hours.\nThe move follows the introduction of daily capped bus fares last September, brought in a year earlier than planned to help with the cost of living, that are now being extended for at least another year, until September 2024. The fares, capped at GBP 2 for single journeys (GBP 1 for children) and GBP 5 for an AnyBus all day travelcard (GBP 2.50 for children), have proved hugely popular with customers and have contributed to an estimated 12% increase in bus trips.\nThe decision to a simplified, integrated and cheaper fare structure is a key part of the Bee Network, Greater Manchester’s plan for a ‘London-style’, high volume, low fare, transport system, which will transform the way people travel across the city region.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(257,'Railway PRO','Czech Republic buys 37 new trains with EU funds','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/czech-republic-buys-37-new-trains-with-eu-funds/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/skoda-sursa-zdopravy.cz_-326x245.jpg','June 23, 2023','2023-09-20 16:56:46','The refurbished railway service in South Moravia, Czech Republic, one of the largest EU-funded investments in the Czech Republic, was inaugurated on Thursday.

This is the case – and a milestone for Hungary – of the East-West Gate rail terminal in Fényeslitke, Hungary, an essential facility and a gate for freight traffic between Europe and Asia. At the terminal, Huawei and its partners deployed the digital technology contributing to country’s 5G development strategy which also determines the wide application of this solution in Hungary’s rail freight sector.\nBy Pamela Luica\nThe trade between Europe and Asia has been taken over by maritime transport but now it is time to shift towards railways, the single transport mode with low emission which can capture massive freight volumes answering mobility demands even in the face of a crisis. According to the Review of Maritime Transport 2022 of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in 2021, 40% of total containerised trade was on the main East-West routes, between Asia, Europe and the United States and the trade on Asia – Europe route increased by 10%. In 2021 and 2022 the pandemic critically challenged maritime transport, causing massive disruption in logistics supply and the war in Ukraine had further impacted the international transport. In all this chaos – with heavily congested ports and airports, railways managed to ensure international freight movement and determined the industry to turn to its services. This contributed to the awareness of the importance of the railway and terminals both from an economic point of view, as well as its minimal impact on the environment, and companies and industries turned their attention to this mode of transport. These reasons determined the increase of rail transport by more than 30% reaching 1.5 million TEU, according to the report of UNCTAD and more rail services have started being provided.\nRail transport and logistics create an ecosystem that can work flexibly, efficiently and quickly with new technologies having the essential role of providing services, capabilities and capacities for the benefit of customers and operators. Practically, the definition of this ecosystem is given by smart technologies, 5G technology unlocking the economy through its capability of high performance and efficiency connecting the industries.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe added value \nThe rail freight terminal in Fényeslitke, Hungary, developed by East-West Intermodal Logistics, is situated in the immediate vicinity of the Hungarian – Ukrainian border, where the European gauge meets the wide gauge railway and ensures the continuity of freight volumes movement between Europe and Asia. The terminal serves as the east-west gateway on the New Silk Road.\nWork on the EUR 96.8 million project started at the beginning of 2021 on an 85-hectare area which provides 10 km of tracks (five 1,520-mm tracks and five European gauge tracks) and a 15,000-square-metre warehouse. The terminal is equipped with three separate 850-metre crane tracks that serve 740 m-long trains at the same time. The cranes have a load capacity of 45 Mt.\nThe East-West Gate (EWG) terminal has one 41-metre wide and two 28-metre-wide cranes on rails, as well as a free ranging 20-metre-high crane. The terminal can handle up to 1.2 million TEUs per year – one of the largest intermodal terminals in Europe – and it is suitable for loading trucks and conventional road semi-trailers onto rail. The terminal has been inaugurated in October 2022, making Europe’s first terminal equipped with 5G MPN network for internal communications and the operation of technological devices. It is also the first terminal in the world where the fully automated overhead cranes of the terminal, which will be able to carry out fine movements too, to be remotely controlled by means of the 5G, which highlights the benefits of this technology in logistics.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nInstead of drivers operating the cranes from a cabin, the cranes are equipped with 20 high-resolution cameras whose images are fed to remote operators. The cranes are also fitted with advanced sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, allowing them to operate with a high degree of accuracy and speed. Large bandwidths are required to upload the images from the cranes and view them in real time, and low latency is needed to accurately control the cranes improving the efficiency of container loading and unloading and the work environment of crane operators. The remote controlling of these cranes significantly reduces the need for workers on the ground as containers are transferred which also boosts the safety at the terminal.\nHuawei has delivered customised high data security private 5G network enabling wireless real-time remote control on the entire container terminal area, significantly increasing the efficiency and changing the working conditions.\nDue to the deployed 5G technology on the cranes – remotely operated through transmitted HD images, the terminal’s operation efficiency increased by 20% from 23–25 TEU/h to 32–35 TEU/h. As cameras have been flexibly deployed to identify and track containers in real time, this reduces the accidents and improves identification accuracy thus determining fewer tallying faults.\nDigital twins offer a way to fundamentally improve logistics efficiency. In the past, wired sensors could not be flexibly deployed, while traditional wireless sensors could not support highly-reliability and low-latency data synchronisation.\nThe 5G technology also provides energy conservation due to the deployment of 100 solar 5G sensors, which allows data to be reported to the terminal’s railway operating system in real time, effectively reducing EWG’s OPEX by up to 40%. The terminal is working based on green resources and technologies which also allows operation of electric terminal tractors and e-cars in the terminal area, and thanks to the deployment of 100 green sites, the zero-carbon-emission terminal is in line with European climate and transport strategies contributing to the development of a sustainable environment.\nWork environment \n5G technology is also an enabler for improved working conditions and provides jobs to attract young workers. It facilitates remote and fine operations of automatic cranes, so operators can work in a more comfortable environment. This has reduced operation risks and the labour costs of this traditionally labour-intensive industry. The project has created about 100 new jobs that require digital skills, and an additional 500 workers are expected to be indirectly employed by the terminal by the end of this year. The digital operations eliminate operation restrictions, thereby providing new employment opportunities, empowering women to better access this sector.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(270,'Railway PRO','Lithuania purchases Flirt trains','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/lithuania-purchases-flirt-trains/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/flirt-emu-ltg-link-2-326x245.jpg','June 21, 2023','2023-09-20 16:58:11','LTG Link, Lithuanian railway operator, awarded Stadler a contract for the supply of 15 Flirt multiple units with plans to exercise optional scope and additionally procure up to 13 electric Flirt Intercity multiple units and 26 battery-electric Flirt trains, 15 of them with 100 km range and 11 with a 70 km range.\nIn a first call-off, Stadler will deliver 9 electric Flirt multiple units for intercity services and six battery-electric Flirt to be operated on non-electrified railway lines.\nThe manufacturer will also supply a technical support and spare parts for 10 years from the delivery of the last vehicle.\nDesigning trains for LTG Link, Stadler’s engineers have focused largely on travel comfort and state-of-the-art vehicle design.

They will bring a significant leap in the quality and experience of train travel for all passengers,” Linas Baužys, the Head of the passenger transport company LTG Link said.\nThe design work for the new multiple units will start soon and they will be built to meet harsh climate conditions and wide gauge railway lines and “together with the supplier that won the public procurement, we will ensure their efficient operation for many years,” Linas Baužys said.\n \n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(271,'Railway PRO','First passenger train crosses Koralm tunnel','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/first-passenger-train-crosses-koralm-tunnel/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Koralmtunnel-Durchquerung-2-OBB-Chris-Zenz-326x245.jpg','June 21, 2023','2023-09-20 16:58:20','The first passenger train officially crossed the 33 km twin tube Koralm tunnel in Austria, after 15 years of construction, linking the southern states of Carinthia and Styria through the Koralmbahn.\nTo mark the milestone, a special train carried the Governor of Carinthia, Peter Kaiser, the Governor of  Styria Christopher Drexler, transport councilors of Styria, Anton Lang, and Carinthia, Sebastian Schuschnig, as well as the Member of the Board for ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG Judith Engel and ÖBB project manager Klaus Schneider.\n“The Koralmbahn is in the final phases and on schedule. We are very proud of this. With the Koralm tunnel we connect Styria and Carinthia in a new transport quality. In just two and a half years, passengers will be traveling relaxed and environmentally friendly through the middle of the Koralpe [Koralm], and in less than an hour from Graz to Klagenfurt. In this way, we are literally leaving the car behind and are creating the mobility of the future,” Judith Engel said.\nThe tunnel has an internal diameter of 10 metres with cross-passages every 500 metres. During the construction, 6 million m³ of material has been excavated, and 160,000 of concrete tunnel lining segments and 13,000 track slabs were installed.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\n“The Koralmbahn will change mobility behavior not only in Carinthia. The regions are becoming more lively, our federal states are moving even closer together, distances are becoming smaller, mobility is becoming more environmentally friendly. With the Koralm tunnel and the Koralmbahn as part of a transport axis connecting Europe, huge new opportunities are emerging from which our children and grandchildren will also benefit – both in terms of quality of life and the opportunity to be able to fulfill their professional dreams <at home>,” Peter Kaiser said.\nThe Koralm tunnel is a part of the new railway line between Graz and Klagenfurt (Koralmbahn) currently under construction which when completed in 2025 will allow trains to run at 250 km/h. The first section between Klagenfurt and St. Paul in Lavanttal will enter operation in 2023 and the entire  Koralmbahn will become operational in 2025 when passenger will travel 45 minutes between Graz and Klagenfurt.\n“The Koralm Tunnel is an internationally renowned piece of engineering and the heart of one of the most important traffic axes of the future – not only for Styria, but for all of Austria. It closes a very important gap in the European infrastructure,” the Governor of Styria said.\nThe 130 km Koralmbahn includes 47 km of tunnels, over 100 bridges and 23 modern stations and stops and is part of new southern route, significantly reducing travel time. From 2030, with the Semmering Base Tunnel, the journey from Vienna to Graz will be reduced to 1:50 hours from currently 2:40 hours and from Vienna to Klagenfurt, travel time will be reduced to 2:40 hours instead of 4:00 hours.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(272,'Railway PRO','Baltimore Red Line project relaunched','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/baltimore-red-line-project-relaunched/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Baltimore-Wes-Moore-Governor-Red-Line-Announcement-326x245.jpg','June 21, 2023','2023-09-20 16:58:25','The Governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, has relaunched the Baltimore Red Line project which was canceled in 2015, now seen as a major investment programme that will enhance east-west connectivity across city’s region.\nThe governor made the announcement at the West Baltimore MARC station joined by Lieutenant Governor Aruna Miller, Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary Paul J. Wiedefeld and Maryland transport officials.\n“Nearly a decade ago, the previous administration cut the Red Line project at a time when Baltimore was reeling from one of the most trying eras in recent history – but now is the time for us to get this right. We’re going to work together and seize this moment in our nation’s history when the stars are aligned to invest in public transit,” the governor said.\nBeginning two decades ago, the Baltimore Red Line proposal sought to improve transit efficiency, fill an east-west transit gap, increase access to work and activity centres, provide connections to existing transit and other transportation modes, offer more commuter choices, and support economic development and community revitalisation. ​\nIn the coming months, the Maryland Transit Administration will lead the next development phase, building on community participation to update and modernise the Red Line plan to meet the region’s mobility needs.\nProject’s key considerations include the transit mode, with both light rail and bus rapid transit options evaluated, tunnelling – exploring options to reduce or eliminate tunnelling in the city centre by using on-street alignments to assess cost, benefits and drawbacks to tunneling, the review of Highlandtown/Bayview alignment and assessment of the environmental changes.\nThe Maryland Transit Administration will request entry into the federal Capital Investment Grants programme in 2024, which requires Federal Transit Administration oversight and would make significant federal financial assistance available to advance the project to full implementation. The institution will also launch the Eastern Baltimore County Access Study to evaluate alignments for further expansions east into Baltimore County. This future phase of the Red Line will seek to connect the current alignment to the job centers in eastern Baltimore County.\nThe first public engagement is scheduled to begin in mid-July and continue through m​id-August 2023.\n“Having signed the original Red Line Community Compact fifteen years ago, I know this project and the tremendous benefits it will bring to the community are long overdue,” Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary Paul J.

SWEG will lease the depot to Siemens Mobility for 30 years from June 2023.\nAs part of the opening ceremony, the Mireo Plus B also took its first public test run on the route between Offenburg and Gengenbach. In addition, Baden-Württemberg’s Transport Minister Winfried Hermann and SWEG CEOs Tobias Harms and Dr. Thilo Grabo signed the transport contract for Network 8 transferring operation of the network from the state to SWEG for 15 years as of December 10, 2023.\nThe new and modern depot will be used to maintain the Siemens Mireo Plus B battery-powered trains that are expected to enter service in the Network 8 Ortenau as of mid-December 2023.\n“This December we will inaugurate the battery-electric age for regional rail transport in Baden-Württemberg in Ortenau. Passengers will travel comfortably in modern, air-conditioned, and barrier-free trains. The trains will operate emission-free on non-electrified routes and thus make an important contribution to climate protection,” the Transport Minister of Baden-Württemberg said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe new battery train depot is located at the train station of Offenburg in the city’s northeast. Covering an area of 1,350 m2, the depot includes two pit tracks, roof work stands, and a full-length gantry crane. Two outbuildings, 350 m2 and 200 m2 in area, provide space for storage, offices, and social facilities. It was also agreed that Siemens Mobility can use the onsite SWEG infrastructure, such as the outdoor car wash. The depot warehouse can rely on a minimum of stock since Siemens Mobility uses its MoBase e-commerce platform for managing spare parts. With it, required parts can be delivered on demand within 24 hours. Condition-based, predictive maintenance of the trains is made possible by using the cloud-based Siemens Mobility application suite Railigent X. Thanks to its advanced algorithms and data analytics, possible faults are detected before they lead to failures.\n“With the new depot for Siemens, an underfloor lathe, and the existing SWEG workshop, SWEG has created a comprehensive service center for rail vehicles here in Offenburg in just five years that is unique in southern Germany in terms of possibilities and modernity,” SWEG CEO Tobias Harms said.\nIn 2020, the Baden-Württemberg State Authority for Rail Vehicles (SFBW) ordered 27 two-car, Mireo Plus B battery-powered trains from Siemens Mobility. Running on batteries, the Mireo Plus B has a range of around 80 kilometers under real conditions.\nAs of mid-December 2023, Network 8 (Ortenau) will include five routes (Offenburg – Freudenstadt/Hornberg, Offenburg – Bad Griesbach, Offenburg – Achern, Achern – Ottenhöfen, and Biberach (Baden) – Oberharmersbach-Riersbach). The reactivated Hermann Hesse railway between Calw and Renningen is expected to join the network in 2025.

After undergoing extensive tests and receiving the operating permit, the first of the new generation of metro carriages officially started running on the U3 line the other day.\n\nThe new rolling stock features an innovative digital passenger information and guidance system and displays real-time information above each door. There is also a new airless braking system, according to a Siemens press release.\nIt ensures greater comfort and safety and optimal accessibility. The digital passenger information and guidance system was developed by Siemens Mobility and, together with Wiener Linien, adapted to meet the specific requirements of Vienna’s public transport system. Continuously updated information is displayed to passengers on screens above all doors inside the X-Wagen metro.\nMetro carriages with airless brakes\nThe screens above the doors that open at the next station show the direction of exits from the station, other lines for transfers and departure times for those lines. The screens above the doors that remain closed at the next station show a digital network map with the current train location, direction of travel, next stop and important transfer options.\nAdditional information, such as planned operating restrictions in the metro system or out-of-service station lifts, can also be displayed on either side of the door.\nFor the first time, the new airless braking system – winner of the German Innovation Award 2023 – from Siemens Mobility is used in the vehicles. The brakes are controlled by a purely electronic signal – brake-by-wire – which is sent from the brake control unit to an intelligent actuator – the brake caliper. The servo motor ensures excellent braking performance, even in poor track conditions.\nBy eliminating the usual compressed air components, weight and installation space are saved at reduced life-cycle costs. In addition, the new system significantly reduces the time until the vehicle is ready for operation.\nWith conventional compressed air brakes, this takes about 12 minutes; with Siemens Mobility’s new airless braking system, it takes only a third of the time. The new X-Wagen metro offers an open-plan interior with spacious entry areas that speed boarding and exiting. Up to 928 passengers can travel on an X-Wagen metro train, exactly 46 more than on the V-train it replaces. Passengers travelling with trolleys or luggage have plenty of space. Seats are made of high-quality materials and are arranged in a combination of standard cross rows with additional seats along the sides, as well as folding seats.\nFrom 2026, the U5 line between Karlsplatz and Frankhplatz will be the first fully automated metro line in Vienna to operate with X-Wagen trains. To prepare for this change, the stations from Karlsplatz to City Hall will be equipped with platform doors and the U5 Frankhplatz station will be rebuilt. Fully automated operation will make the metro even safer and more reliable. The platform doors will only open when the train has stopped and is properly positioned in the station.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(279,'Railway PRO','VIDEO Protest against the Lyon-Turin railway project.

The aim was to observe how the hybrid regional train performs on real line profiles and in real conditions, according to the timetable of a commercial service. Commercial service will begin in a few months, as soon as the Etablissement Public de Sécurité Ferroviaire (EPSF) has issued the necessary authorisations for passenger transport.\nThis is the first hybridisation project for a Régiolis train in France. It was launched in 2018 by the SNCF Group and Alstom, with the mobilisation and financial participation of 4 French Regions (Occitanie, Grand Est, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, and Centre-Val de Loire), and the provision by the Occitanie Region of a trainset from its liO fleet. The objectives are to reduce energy consumption and cut greenhouse gas emissions, thanks to a solution that allows the existing thermal fleet to be modified without having to modify the existing infrastructure.\nAlong with the battery-powered train and the hydrogen train, the hybrid train is one of the three decarbonisation technologies that the SNCF Group is developing with its partners Alstom, CAF, and the French Regions for passenger transport on non-electrified (or partially electrified) regional lines.\nHybridisation of the Régiolis trainset involved replacing half of the thermal engines with energy storage systems consisting of lithium-ion batteries. This operation was carried out at the beginning of 2021 at the CAF site in Reichshoffen, formerly owned by Alstom, following an initial validation phase for the new energy storage systems at the end of 2020 at the Alstom site in Tarbes, centre of excellence for “green traction” systems.\nOne car of the train has also been temporarily fitted with a laboratory and multiple sensors to measure the train’s energy flows.\nAt the end of this test phase, on 14 June, the electric-diesel-battery train was presented at the Occitanie Technicentre by Jean-Luc Gibelin, Vice-President of the Occitanie Region with responsibility for Mobility and Transport Infrastructure, Philippe Bru, Regional Director of SNCF Voyageurs Occitanie, and Kaïs Albouchi, Director of the Régiolis Hybrid and Hydrogen Projects at Alstom.\nEquipped with its two energy storage systems and its laboratory car, the trainset has started its tests in the second half of 2021. A static and dynamic fine-tuning phase at up to 60 km/h took place at Reichshoffen to check the train’s operation and test the hybrid traction mode. Tests then continued on the Vélim test track in the Czech Republic, with validation and certification tests at up to 160 km/h. This enabled all the train’s new traction modes to be tested at their operating speed, and the route simulation models to be validated.\nThe tests showed that the train performed as expected. The braking energy recovery rate, used to recharge the batteries, is very high, at over 90%, enabling energy savings of up to 20%, depending on the route. The zero-emission battery-powered mode is designed to power the train for a few kilometres without the need to use internal combustion engines, a feature that could be useful for low-carbon journeys in built-up areas. On non-electric lines, the hybrid regional train retains the range of the initial model for up to 1,000 km.\nWith the final tests on the national rail network having taken place in April, SNCF Voyageurs has now to submit the admission file to the Etablissement public de sécurité ferroviaire (EPSF) with a view to obtaining the necessary authorisations for its commercial operation. SNCF Voyageurs will also use this period to prepare for the launch of the trainset in the various regions (traffic plan, staff training, etc.).\nThe start of the experimental commercial service is scheduled for the end of 2023 in Occitanie, particularly on the Mazamet – Toulouse and Rodez – Toulouse lines. The modified trainset will then run throughout 2024 in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Grand Est, and Centre-Val de Loire regions.\nThe development of the hybrid electric-diesel-battery train had a total budget of EUR 16,85 million, of which SNCF and Alstom each contributed with EUR 3.8 million euro, Occitanie, Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Grand Est regions with EUR 3 million each and the Centre Val de Loire Region with EUR 250,000.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(281,'Railway PRO','Alstom unveils the Coradia Stream design for Renfe','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/alstom-unveils-the-coradia-stream-design-for-renfe/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/alstom-coradia-renfe-326x245.jpg','June 19, 2023','2023-09-20 16:59:10','Alstom has unveiled the design of the Coradia Stream train for Renfe at its industrial site in Catalonia in the presence of the Spanish Minister of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda, Raquel Sánchez, and the President of Renfe, Raül Blanco.\nThe new trains will have 6 cars each, of which 4 low-floor cars and 2 double-deck cars. The 12 doors on each side, evenly distributed along the train, improve station dwell time by speeding up passenger flow and the transport capacity of suburban networks. In addition, the future trains, fully accessible for people with reduced mobility, will have spaces for PRM chairs, and multifunctional spaces for bicycles, suitcases, baby prams and more.\nThe Coradia Stream train for Renfe will be 900 metres long and will have a capacity for more than 900 passengers allowing the operator to transport at least 20% more passengers per hour through the country’s busiest railway hubs.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nTechnically, the new high-capacity vehicles will be equipped with state-of-the-art equipment to improve reliability and punctuality. In addition, the technology implemented will allow for thousands of data per second to be collected from the entire fleet. This real-time information ensures more efficient operational decision-making, which will result in a better service for commuters.\nThe first three units that are currently being manufactured and the validation and certification process will begin in 2024. Once this is over, series production of the remaining 198 units will begin, with the aim of delivering between 3 and 4 trains to Renfe each month.\nIn 2021, Renfe awarded Alstom a EUR 1.44 billion for the supply of 152 high-capacity trains for Cercanías networks, and in December 2022, the Spanish rail operator ordered 49 additional Coradia Stream trains. Under the contracts, Alstom will supply 201 Coradia Stream high-capacity trains at a value of EUR 1.8 billion.

As such, the log and its shape were highlighted, with an immediate and instinctive brand association by 56% of French people. The shape of the logo thus became the starting point in the approach to creating the new “colourful, flexible, playful and dynamic” identity\nThe new brand architecture has redesigned the SNCF brand ecosystem and now allows each company within the group to start with a dedicated and differentiated visual identity. The different SNCF companies thus have their own brand universes.\n“To affirm our commitment to all French people, we have chosen a strong slogan, <For all of us> (Pour nous tous in the original). We have created a signature logo, which is mainly used in colour on a white background,” says the SNCF group.\nThe internal launch, within the rail group, took place in March this year, and is being implemented bit by bit.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(283,'Railway PRO','Siemens will invest EUR 2 billion in new global plan','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/siemens-will-invest-eur-2-billion-in-new-global-plan/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Siemens-Vestron-326x245.jpg','June 15, 2023','2023-09-20 16:59:18','Siemens will invest EUR 2 billion for a new global plan, the German engineering and technology group announced Thursday, as it prepares to respond to increased demand triggered by global stimulus packages.\nIn a press release, Siemens said it will build new plants, research and development centres and training facilities around the world, with the aim of addressing problems highlighted by the COVID pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions.\n“Siemens is growing significantly above the market average.

The new passenger trainsets of Swiss manufacturer Stadler have diesel propulsion with the possibility of later electrification.\nThe contract is worth EUR 148.3 million and the first deliveries are scheduled for 2025. Dušan Mes, director of Slovenian Railways (SŽ), says this completes the rolling stock renewal cycle – a total of 72 new vehicles to be put into service by the end of 2025.\nSwiss trains\nThe total investment amounts to almost half a billion euros. “With the renewal of the lines and the construction of a new passenger centre after 2026, public passenger rail services will certainly improve significantly. I realistically estimate that we will be comparable with more developed Nordic countries such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland. It is also our goal – to have a similar number of passengers per total population as in these countries. Today we carry 15 million passengers, and the ultimate goal is 30 million passengers by 2030.”\nInfrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek said that when she took office, she stressed that one of her top priorities was a “green”, sustainable and safe railway.\nRailway station renovated with EU funds\nWednesday is important for Slovenia from another point of view. Also on Wednesday, the symbolic opening of the Grosuplje railway station, which was financed by EU funds, was celebrated: “In this way, we wanted to show that we are investing on both ends – in infrastructure, and here we are scientifically increasing the absorption of funds. If we invested 300 million in 2022, we will invest 470 million this year.”\nGolob stressed that freight traffic is even more important than passenger traffic. “We all know that the situation on the roads today is unfortunately catastrophic and we all know that freight traffic must be taken off the roads as soon as possible. The only alternative to this is rail, so I hope for major future steps in this area.”\nSlovenske Železnice completed the first phase of rolling stock renewal last September, when the last of 52 new Stadler trains was delivered. Since then, 21 Flirt double-deck electric trains, ten Kiss double-deck electric trains and 21 Flirt single-deck diesel trains have been running on Slovenian tracks.\nMes also said that with the new timetables some direct trains are being implemented, which means better journey times, especially on links between larger cities. “This will already be in the timetable for 2024 and to a greater extent in 2025. We are looking at renewing the lines,” he said. According to him, the 52 trains that SŽ has already taken over represent much more comfortable journeys and greater capacity (the double-decker Stadlers can carry more than 550 passengers). “Passenger numbers have increased by almost two million. As Premier Golob said, the state is building infrastructure, and SŽ is building better services related to the new trains.”\nAccording to him, the new trains are capable of running at 140 km/h and some sections are already adapted to this. “In terms of better train speed or journey times, there are direct trains, which means fewer stops. As far as regional lines are concerned, it is up to the state to double certain sections, at least partially. At the moment, the biggest challenge is to be able to increase the number of trains, at least in terms of shorter distances to Ljubljana (…) At the moment, only a direct train can mean a better time,” he added. The aim is for passengers to get from Maribor to Ljubljana in less than 90 minutes. “When the work is finished, hopefully by 2025, we will achieve this.”\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(288,'Railway PRO','Radom – Warsaw railway modernisation completed','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/radom-warsaw-railway-modernisation-completed/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Radom-station-326x245.jpg','June 14, 2023','2023-09-20 16:59:45','PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe has completed the modernisation of Radom – Warsaw railway line which now allows trains to run at a speed of 160 km/h from 100-120 km/h.

Another option for Ukraine to receive CEF-Energy support is for cross-border projects in the field of renewable energy.\nAssociating Ukraine and CEF will also boost digital sector as the EU financial tool provides support for connectivity projects of common interest, in particular for backbone networks linking the EU with third countries, as well as for the development of safe, secure and sustainable high-performance infrastructure, including Gigabit and fifth-generation of mobile (5G) networks.\nOnce the next CEF Digital calls are launched, entities in Ukraine will be able to apply for co-financing for projects aimed at increasing the capacity, security and resilience of digital connectivity between Ukraine and its EU neighbours.\nIn July 2021, the Connecting Europe Facility budget was adopted with a EUR 33.71 billion budget, out of which EUR 25.8 billion for transport sector, EUR 5.8 billion for energy and EUR 2 billion for the digital segment that will boost European connectivity infrastructures.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(293,'Railway PRO','Four months of tests for the Automatic Train Operation system in Switzerland','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/automatic-train-operation-system-in-switzerland/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Automatic-Train-Operation-326x245.jpg','June 13, 2023','2023-09-20 17:00:14','There will be four months of testing between November 2023 and February 2024 for the Automatic Train Operation system in Switzerland, when a remote-controlled train will perform simple shunting for CFF.\nIn order to achieve this, the state-owned railway company in the Cantons, CFF, have posted a call for tenders seeking a “traction vehicle with specific functionality”. The rail operator wants to hire a train that can be remotely controlled and equipped with “perception sensors”. The package also includes a control unit with at least one camera for remote monitoring.\nAs part of the tests, it is planned to carry out trials using remote-controlled shunting movements, CFF explained. The train driver will be able to steer the vehicle from outside the driver’s cab in front of a screen. On this occasion, the CFF wants to check whether vehicles can be remotely transported in the event of a breakdown, with verification of European automation standards.\nIf the tests prove successful, the technology should reduce delays on passenger trains. “Often a disruption has repercussions for staff intervention. If a locomotive repairman cannot be at the scheduled place and time because of a disruption, he cannot do the planned intervention. In certain circumstances, this may cause delays for passengers. If a vehicle could be operated independently of staff intervention, the consequences of the disruption could be limited,” explains SBB spokesman Reto Schärli.\nAdvantages of introducing Automatic Train Operation system in Switzerland\nAutomatic Train Operation (ATO) technology has been on the radar of railway managers for several years, and numerous projects are underway. ATO assistance systems have the potential to save energy or to run trains without passengers on board.\n“For the vast majority of railways in Switzerland, the main goal of automation is to make rail operations more efficient. In the event of danger caused by an obstacle on the line and there are passengers on board the train, the train must be able to warn of this or brake, but as far as possible without false alarms and unnecessary emergency braking,” the Federal Office for Transport said.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(294,'Railway PRO','Rail bridges in Krakow completed','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/rail-bridges-in-krakow-completed/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PKP-Krakow-bridge-new-stop-326x245.jpg','June 13, 2023','2023-09-20 17:00:18','Poland’s rail infrastructure manager PKP PLK has completed the construction of the last of the three rail bridges in Krakow over the Vistula River allowing long-distance, suburban, and regional train services from June 11.\nTrain timetable and rail traffic on Krakow rail network are improved following the completion of the new bridge which allows the trains between the two largest stations to run on four tracks. The capacity of one of the most important sections of the E30 international railway line will increase.\n“In Krakow, you can clearly see the metamorphosis that the Polish railway has undergone recently. Such positive and revolutionary changes have not been seen for years. New tracks on flyovers and bridges will significantly increase the potential of railways in southern Poland,” the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk said.\nThis commissioning of the third rail bridge over the Vistula River was the main component necessary to put into service all tracks in the centre of Krakow. The bridge is situated in the vicinity of the Krakow Zabłocie stop, 5 km southeast of city centre. Due to the new structure the station benefits increased access while Krakow residents gain additional space to cross the river as railway track, a bicycle path and a footbridge have been built on the new bridge. The new infrastructure also allows people with reduced mobility to use easily all facilities due to a friendly design.\nThe project has changed the centre of Krakow. In order to find a place for two new tracks, 700-meter-long railway flyovers were built in place of the 19th-century embankment which allows the space under the railway line to be redesigned with new communication routes, places for rest and recreation for the benefit of the citizens. In addition, the existing rail viaducts have been enlarged to accommodate additional tracks.\n“We have built a new railway in Krakow. Additional tracks on new flyovers, bridges and viaducts will increase the potential of rail transport, especially for agglomeration connections. It will be a fast, sustainable and increasingly popular means of communication, which will facilitate traveling throughout the region,” Grzegorz Kurdziel, member of the management board of PKP PLK.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nEach of the three bridges built over the Vistula River is of different width, but they have a similar structure. They consist of three arched spans with the largest of them being 116 meter-long and 18 meters high. Trains will be able to run on the bridges at a speed of up to 100 km/h.\nThe project for the construction of the three rail bridges in Krakow has a value of PLN 1.2 billion (EUR 270.7 million) and is co-financed by the European Union under the Connecting Europe Facility under the project “Works on the E30 railway line, Kraków Główny Towarowy-Rudzice section, including the construction of metropolitan line tracks”. Within the 2015 CEF Transport call, a EUR 195 million financing was provided from the eligible value of the project of EUR 240.87 million.\n“I welcome the completion of this important CEF project in Poland. A modernised urban railway, new bridges, new stops and modern control systems are changing the railway in this second largest Polish city. Thanks to this EU investment, Krakow will launch an agglomeration railway that will improve the condition of the natural environment,” Morten Jensen, Head of Unit at CINEA said.\nThe E30 railway line is running through Krakow city centre and its modernisation and expansion provide additional capacity for rail transport in Lesser Poland.\nThe scope of the project also included the modernisation of the lines 133 and 91 totalling 19.6 km, the construction of two metropolitan tracks on Kraków Główny Osobowy – Kraków Płaszów section and one track on the Kraków Płaszów – Kraków Bieżanów rail section both on the city’s agglomeration network, the demolition, reconstruction or construction of engineering structures, the construction of the new rail bridges over Vistula River and new passenger stops.

Projects also include signalling modernisation of Southwest Chief train service between Colorado and New Mexico, rail enhancements in Montana for Empire Builder train, I-20 Crescent service extension from Mississippi through Louisiana to Texas and the construction of new Crystal City station that would add service to Arlington, in Virginia.\nOperator’s long distance train services “are vital mobility and economic links for communities around the country and we’re continually working to enhance them. These grant applications reiterate our commitment to improving service for all Amtrak customers, from small, rural towns to major metropolitan areas,” Amtrak Board Chairman Tony Coscia said.\nIn addition to these long distance grant applications submitted in conjunction with various partners, Amtrak also applied for several grants to improve Northeast Corridor and State Supported routes and provided letters of support for 83 projects outside the Northeast Corridor submitted by others. On the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak submitted 14 projects for a USD 7.3 billion federal funding to cover the investment needed in modernising and improving the train stations, the rail infrastructure, signalling systems and expand the services.\nIn FY2022, operator’s long distance ridership increased by 56.1% compared to the similar period of 2021 reaching almost 3.5 million passengers, representing 15% of Amtrak’s total ridership. The company operates three main long distance routes (Southeast, Central and Southwest routes) comprising of 15 passenger train services on a network of 1,200 – 4,000 km.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nUnder the Infrastructure Law, FRA has been required to evaluate the restoration of daily intercity passenger service and to explore the potential for new long distance train services / routes to be operated by Amtrak. As a result, a study will be developed based also on stakeholder engagement, a process that began in September 2022 and will be concluded in late 2023. The study aims at delivering a vision to create a unitary long distance rail service system which is able to remove the missing links and deliver passengers increased accessibility to such services as well as to reduce travel time and provide additional connections.\nAcross the U.S., the discontinued routes are estimated at a length of over 9,500 km and cover the Pan American route (which would link Orleans and Cincinnati), George Washington route (between St. Louis – Missouri and Washington, D.C.), Floridian train (between Chicago, St. Petersburg and Miami) and San Francisco Chief line (between Chicago and Richmond).\nThe FRA’s Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service study identifies 36 routes which can be restored of expanded to provide connections to the towns and regions who do not have such train services and will encourage people to choose rail services against road transport.\nApart from a geographical perspective (there are six identified regions), the study analyses the potential of the routes considering the average length of the journey, the type of the provided service (such as standard, sleeper, business, as well as daily and night train services), performance criteria and the issues causing the train delays.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(297,'Railway PRO','Sqills to provide Snälltåget inventory and reservation system','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/sqills-to-provide-snalltaget-inventory-and-reservation-system/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Snalltaget--326x245.jpeg','June 13, 2023','2023-09-20 17:00:35','Swedish open-access rail operator Snälltåget awarded Sqills, a Siemens Mobility subsidiary, a contract to implement S3 Passenger system, an inventory and reservation solution.\nThe two companies have opted for a phased approach in terms of implementation.

The installation of the European safety system is and will remain a top priority for Infrabel Together with the automated rail traffic management systems, ETCS offers our customers the highest level of safety and strengthens Belgium’s position as having one of the best equipped and therefore the safest in Europe,” Benoît Gilson, CEO Infrabel said.\nFollowing the ETCS deployment on the Brussels-Midi – Halle rail line, Infrabel managed to equip 54% of its rail network, representing 3,462 km. The aim is to install ETCS on the entire Belgian railway rail infrastructure by the end of 2025.\nThe Belgian rail network is equipped with the ETCS L1 (limited and full supervision solutions) with full supervision deployed on the Corridor C, the freight axis from the port of Antwerp via Leuven and Namur to Athus, and on lines 10 and 36C/2 and the Ans – Angleur section and line 36/37 equipped with ETCS level 2. The lines where the ETCS1+2 FS with full supervision is installed, it allows the train driver to receive signal and speed information it its cab. This system is installed on high-speed lines to Germany and to the Netherlands.\nThe network is also equipped with TVM-430 (transmission voies-machine), a French system implemented only on high-speed line 1 between Lembeek and the French border. The operation is similar to ETCS as the driver’s cab picks up a signal transmitted by the tracks, informing the driver of his speed in relation to the authorised speed limit.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(304,'Railway PRO','Hitachi Rail disappointed on CMA merger investigation','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/hitachi-rail-disappointed-on-cma-merger-investigation/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thales-326x245.png','June 12, 2023','2023-09-20 17:01:16','Hitachi Rail is “disappointed” by findings of the provisional investigation of the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) related to the merger with Thales and says that it will examine the concerns.\n“We are disappointed by the CMA’s provisional findings and will now closely examine how we can respond to the concerns raised. Hitachi remains of the firm view that the merger will not substantially lessen competition for UK signalling projects,” a Hitachi Rail spokesperson said.\nThe Japanese company will review the proposed provisional findings “as a matter of absolute priority and we remain committed to addressing the CMA’s concerns through a cooperative approach. Our focus now is to find the best potential mitigations and an appropriate way forward.”\nFor the merger with Thales, Hitachi says that the regulatory approvals are secured “all other relevant jurisdictions except the EU, where we are making good progress towards securing clearance from the European Commission this summer. This merger will be good for competition and benefit customers in the UK and internationally.”\nFollowing a provisionally investigation, on June 8, 2023, the British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced that this transaction could result in fewer choices and options for Network Rail and TfL, which are investing million of euros to maintain and upgrade the signalling systems.\nThe authority says that the “should the merger go ahead, there would be fewer credible bidders remaining for digital mainline signalling tenders, which could raise costs for Network Rail and negatively impact the digitalisation of the UK’s rail network.\nIn august 2021 Hitachi Rail agreed to acquire Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business at EUR 1.66 billion. With the complementary strength of GTS’s signalling activities, and rapid growth in MaaS and digitisation in the rail sector, GTS will help Hitachi Rail to potentially reach EUR 7.7 billion revenue and double-digit adjusted operating income ratio by FY2026, or around four years from closing.\nIn December 2022, the two companies made substantially progress towards the completion of the merger including the necessary approvals.

The agreement will see the company supply the Guinea Bauxite Company with 244,000 steel sleepers, its largest ever order for rail sleepers.\n“We operate in a highly competitive market so it’s extremely pleasing that Infrabel has selected us to supply rail for the Belgian network once more.

The Inquiry Group has provisionally found that Thales and Hitachi are well placed to compete to deliver mainline signalling projects in the Great Britain. Should the merger go ahead, there would be fewer credible bidders remaining for digital mainline signalling tenders, which could raise costs for Network Rail and negatively impact the digitalisation of the UK’s rail network.\nThe CMA also assessed the impact of the merger on competition to replace the signalling systems on London’s highly complex underground lines. The Inquiry Group has provisionally found that the transaction could reduce the limited number of global suppliers with the capabilities to challenge Thales, the main provider of signalling systems to London Underground, reducing competition for future urban signalling tenders in the UK, particularly London.\nHitachi and Thales SA’s Ground Transportation business are two of the leading global suppliers of signalling systems for mainline and urban railway networks, alongside Siemens and Alstom.\nOverall, the Inquiry Group provisionally concluded that the Hitachi-Thales GTS merger is likely to reduce choice, options, and competition in markets where there are only very few competitors and could lead to worse outcomes for Network Rail and London Underground with an adverse knock-on effect on passengers and taxpayers.\nIn the UK, Network Rail is planning to upgrade much of the country’s rail signalling system over the next decade, deploying new digital technologies. Transport for London (TfL) is also expected to begin replacing the signalling systems on two of London’s main underground lines over a similar period. Historically, a very small number of suppliers have dominated the provision of both mainline and urban rail signalling systems in the UK.\nAs in the UK, “millions of pounds” are spent every year to maintain and upgrade the signalling systems, “healthy competition in this market is essential to support innovation as well as to keep costs down,” Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent Inquiry Group, said.\nThe CMA will now consult on its provisional findings and potential remedies to ensure competition is protected in the supply of both digital mainline and urban signalling in the UK. This could range from requiring Hitachi or Thales to sell parts of their existing businesses to prohibiting the merger altogether.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(307,'Railway PRO','Sydney Metro opens new concourse at Central Station','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/sydney-metro-opens-new-concourse-at-central-station/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sydney_CSM-North-South-Concourse_006-326x245.jpg','June 9, 2023','2023-09-20 17:01:29','Sydney Metro has opened Central station concourse part of upgrade works of Australia’s busiest railway station.

This is an outstanding highlight, because the Canfranc line is a particularly demanding line due to its steep and high gradients, which involve a great challenge for the new power generation systems. To this end, the demonstrator train, a Renfe’s Civia commuter unit, has run on the Zaragoza – Canfranc line both in electric mode, in the electrified area, and in hybrid mode, combining energy from hydrogen fuel cells and batteries in the non-electrified sections.\nA new stage of on-track testing is now underway with the aim of testing the new technology in a wide range of power and energy demand conditions, simulating different commercial services. To this end, the bi-mode train is scheduled to run on different lines of the Spanish railway network, mainly on lines in Aragon, Madrid and Galicia. The test scenarios include running under different climatic and operating conditions. This will allow a more complete characterisation of the new on-board technology, for the subsequent evaluation of the competitiveness of the new bi-mode hybrid propulsion solution with hydrogen fuel cells as a sustainable alternative to the diesel traction currently used on many lines.\nThe electric-hydrogen train is based on one existing Renfe commuter trainset, in which CAF has installed a new power generation system that uses the hybridisation of energy from hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. This new power system has been integrated into the vehicle’s existing traction system. After the static testing phase at the CAF’s plant in Zaragoza and the first hydrogen refuelling, the dynamic tests began in mid-2022 on a closed track, which have served to optimise the new power system prior to the current testing phase on representative lines of the Spanish railway network.\nThe start of this new testing phase has meant the first authorisation from Adif for the circulation in tests of a hydrogen train on the country’s rail infrastructure, passing all the risk analysis and safety validation processes inherent to the testing of new technologies. At the same time, the train drivers and train managers from Renfe have received the necessary training to drive the Civia train converted to a bi-mode hydrogen train.\nThe success in the development of this project confirms and reinforces the commitment of the companies that make up the FCH2Rail consortium to the development of environmentally friendly mobility solutions.\nThe project began in 2021 and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2024. The project has a EUR 14 million budget, EUR 10 million of which is being funded by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, formerly FCH2 JU, the European Commission agency dedicated to promoting the development of hydrogen and fuel cells.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(317,'Railway PRO','VIDEO.

This way, large distances can be covered with solar panels in a short time.\nThe electricity generated by the solar panels could initially be used by households near the railway. In the future, the energy will be used to power electric trains. Sun-Ways representatives claim that 5,000 km of railway track covered with solar panels generates enough energy for 750,000 households each year.\n\nSun-Ways’ 2023 target\nSun-Ways is currently made up of a small team of members with complementary skills. As of 2021, the company’s employees are working hard to overcome engineering challenges and manufacture the already patented solar panel system, and the installation of the pilot project has become the main goal for this year.\n“Our solution is but a stepping stone to the global environmental and energy challenge. We could not continue to produce electricity as we are doing now. In our view, the solar energy market is only at the beginning of its full potential, and its use can only grow in the years to come,” say the co-founders of the Swiss company that wants to install solar panels between railway tracks, Joseph Scuderi and Baptiste Danichert, in a message posted on their official website.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(318,'Railway PRO','Public transport sector joins forces for society','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/public-transport-sector-joins-forces-for-society/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/UITP-Barcelona-Declaration-326x245.jpg','June 7, 2023','2023-09-20 17:02:26','Dozens of leaders of global public transport sector joined the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) and signed the Barcelona Declaration in an effort to demonstrate their unwavering commitment to public transport. The signing ceremony took place at the UITP 2023 summit held for the third time in Barcelona, Spain.\nThe declaration serves as a testament to the undeniable and indispensable role of public transport in daily lives, benefiting everyone, everywhere. It plays an intrinsic role in facilitating movement, fostering employment, supporting cities and economies, preserving the environment, promoting good health, and much more.\n“As the public transport sector, representing all shared and collective modes of public transport, we stand for people, for our staff, for the persons we bring to their destinations, for everyone,” the signatories say.\nThe declaration highlights the tremendous role public transport has for “people, progress and planet” the three core elements of the document.\nPublic transport connects people by linking communities, strengthening the social fabric throughout the world. This sector makes travel accessible and affordable and offers equal opportunities to everyone while guaranteeing access to essential services like schools, hospitals and work. A good public transport infrastructure takes private cars off the road and improves road safety and frees up space for people. Public transport improves people’s health as determines people to involve in active mobility (walking or cycling), improves air quality and fights air pollution, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) associates with 4.2 million premature deaths per year.\nWith a modal shift to public transport, traffic volumes decrease resulting in lower exposure to traffic noise, giving you a better night’s sleep and relieving hypertension.\n“We stand for a flourishing economy. Public transport connects people to jobs, training and leisure, supports tourism, increases land and property value, and helps all areas thrive. It even does this beyond towns and cities through connections and jobs in its supply chain, which deliver the infrastructure and vehicles needed,” the declaration says. According to UITP, one euro invested in this sector generates 4-5 euro to the local economy.\nAt the sale time, this sector is among the largest employers at the local level providing secure local jobs and involves diverse staff, with very different backgrounds. In addition, it is committed to increasing the employment of women and reinforces social inclusion. For the same amount invested, public transport creates 25% more jobs than road construction.\nPublic transport fosters and is driven by innovation, “from providing e-mobility long before electric cars were used, to deploying autonomous metros for over 35 years. As the sector looks to the future, new research and development areas include hydrogen, artificial intelligence, autonomous road vehicles, and many others.”\nAs climate change is the most challenge the world is facing, public transport is the best option to reduce transport emissions contributing to global ambitious goals. In addition, the sector is rapidly advancing and is committed to continue to decarbonise itself. Through the Barcelona Declaration, UITP and the CEOs are standing for the planet. “We believe in public transport because it is the most climate friendly way of traveling besides walking and cycling. Public transport carbon emissions per passenger are 3 to 4 times lower than with cars. For citizens’ daily mobility, a modal shift to collective public transport and active mobility is needed if we want to achieve our climate goals.”\nThe signatories of the declaration include transport operators and local and regional institutions and the transport related industry, from all around the world. UITP says that the Barcelona Declaration remains open for signatures, and CEOs of UITP’s Premium members are invited to express their support.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(319,'Railway PRO','Bulgaria buys EUR 1.4 billion rolling stock with EU funds','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/bulgaria-buys-eur-1-4-billion-rolling-stock-with-eu-funds/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bulgaria-326x245.jpg','June 6, 2023','2023-09-20 17:02:31','Bulgaria’s Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications is launching a tender for rolling stock worth BGN 2.8 billion excluding VAT (€1.4 billion).\n\nThe winners of the four tenders will have to supply 35 single-deck EMUs and 7 double-deck EMUs, 20 traction locomotives and 18 shunting locomotives, provide train staff and ensure maintenance for 15 years.

It’s pivotal position to bring enormous benefits to the world should be strengthened by the policy makers that through actions and measures can meet climate issue while providing opportunities to communities.\nIts essential position to bring enormous benefits to the world is to be approached both from the perspective of decarbonisation, as well as from other angles such as a much more compact thinking of what urban public transport means as an ecosystem, its redefinition, the contribution to development the business environment, but also the workforce.\n“To attract the attention of political decision-makers, UITP together with leaders of public transport sector will sign a joint declaration – Barcelona Declaration – which highlights the importance of public transport and what it can do for people, for progress and for the planet – the decarbonisation being an essential aspect,” Mohamed Mezghani, the Secretary General of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) said at the global public transport summit held in Barcelona on 4-7 June.\nThe representative of the association has underlined some aspects the public transport needs to be approached to deliver society great benefits.\n“First, I would like to reiterate the decarbonisation issue that, in this sector, can be solved by the public transport which helped several cities to cut emissions. And this means it is doing its work. When we shift from car to public transport undoubtedly, we contribute to the reduction of emissions. In addition, this sector is renewing its fleet by acquiring and introducing new electric vehicles to replace the existing ones,” Mohamed Mezghani explained.\nAccording to a survey of UITP member, 72% already have a carbon neutrality target or a vision and 81% of the operators and authorities already have an energy transition strategy including both electrification of the vehicle fleet and investing in new and modern vehicles powered alternative energy sources such as hydrogen and biofuels.\nThe transition to renewable energy, acquiring and introduction of zero-emission vehicles and digital technologies and make public transport more attractive are key to a modal shift. Transport sector accounts for a quarter of global energy-related CO2 emissions at global level. And even though the number of clean busses increased rapidly, nearly doubling in Europe over the past five years, ‘non clean vehicles’ still make up 77% of bus fleets globally according to the UITP survey. Decarbonising public transport and increasing its modal share is the fastest and most cost-efficient way to achieve decarbonised mobility.\nThe second issue consists of the redefinition of the urban public transport which is not a mass transit system anymore. It incorporates car sharing, bike sharing as well as scooter sharing. The problem is the car. So, we have to combine mass transit with the other mobility means creating a true public transport system proving people the best options to travel,” UITP Secretary General said.\nAs a consequence of the covid pandemic a new aspect this sector is facing is related skills shortages including driver and mechanical jobs at global level. As an example, in cities like Vienna and Brussels the public transport is the first employer. Thus, UITP’s message underlines that “public transport needs to strengthen its brand as an employer who is also embracing diversity. We need to make public transport more attractive in this respect, too. Although of the total number of passengers, the largest share – 70-80% is represented by women, they are employed in a small part – about 22%, which highlights the need for a different approach.”\nOther underlined issues refer to digitalisation, which also plays a key role in public transport ability to modernise itself, as well as the business model which need to be tackled from cost and revenue point of view. The increased prices in energy put pressure on operators’ costs which are also facing challenges in revenues – a policy that can be regulated by local and regional authorities. According to UITP, energy costs account for roughly 30% to 50% of the total public transport budget. Transitioning to owned sustainable energy supplies or cooperating with energy providers and local stakeholders can save costs.\nA common and comprehensive approach to shift private car journeys to urban public transport will result in a better environment and “we have to convince policy makers to think on long term as the results of actions and measures can be seen over a 10-15-year period. This will be in the benefit of cities and our environment, while boosting business environments,” Mohamed Mezghani concluded.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(326,'Railway PRO','Ukraine will participate in the rehabilitation of 400 km of railway in Moldova','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/ukraine-will-participate-in-the-rehabilitation-of-400-km-of-railway-in-moldova/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Moldova-railway-326x245.jpg','June 6, 2023','2023-09-20 17:03:06','Four hundred kilometres of railway track in the Republic of Moldova will be rehabilitated in cooperation with Ukraine’s state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia.\nA Memorandum was signed in Vinnitsa (a city in western Ukraine) by representatives of Ukrzaliznytsia and the State Railway Enterprise of Moldova (Calea Ferată din Moldova), under which reconstruction work on 400 km of railways will be carried out with the participation of Ukrainian specialists.\nThis is the North-South Railway Corridor of the Republic of Moldova: Valcineț – Ocnita – Balti – Ungheni – Calarasi – Calinari.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Commission have already approved a financial package in which the EU will provide an investment grant of EUR 20 million and the EBRD will provide the Moldovan government with EUR 23 million. In total, the financing package is worth EUR 71 million (EUR 28 million will be invested from other sources).\nThe project will also contribute to food security by facilitating access for Ukrainian goods to the largest operational port on the Black Sea, Constanța (in eastern Romania), as well as to the Romanian, Moldovan and Ukrainian ports of Galati, Reni, Ismail and Giurgiulesti. They have a cumulative operating capacity that can absorb a significant part of Ukraine’s export needs.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(327,'Railway PRO','Construction launched for Florence high-speed bypass','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/construction-launched-for-florence-high-speed-bypass/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Firenze-Regione-Toscana-326x245.jpg','June 5, 2023','2023-09-20 17:03:10','Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) started the construction of Florence high-speed bypass running which includes the railway under-crossing of the city and the new Florence Belfiore high-speed station.\nThe Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Matteo Salvini, the President of the Tuscany Region, Eugenio Giani, the Mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, the CEO of FS Italiane, Luigi Ferraris, and the CEO of Impresa Pizzarotti & C, Carlo Luzzatto, attended the official event held on May 15, 2023.\nThe bypass will run for about 7 km underground with two parallel tunnels 20 metres below the surface, completed with two above-ground terminal sections: to the north between the Firenze Castello and Firenze Rifredi stations and to the south near the Firenze Campo di Marte station. The tunnels will be excavated using mechanised techniques availing of EPB TBMs (Earth Pressure Balance Tunnel Boring Machines) with a diameter of approximately 9.5 metres.\nIn November 2022, the Florentia Consortium comprising Pizzarotti and Saipem was awarded the EUR 1.3 billion contract and in December 2022 the first delivery of the construction site areas took place while in January 2023 the consortium started the preparatory activities.\nExcavation is expected to begin in the summer of 2023 when work will also start for the new Belfiore station.

In 2021 the system had been installed on 98 vehicles, for 370 vehicles the contracts have been signed (including new vehicles to be delivered with the ETCS and retrofitted vehicles) while projects have been submitted for the financing of 275 vehicles. For 482 vehicles the situation is somewhat uncertain.\nIn 2021, the Czech government adopted the “Modern signalling plan on the rail network – ETCS implementation” plan highlighting the vision to install the new system on 4,600 km lines until 2030 when 5,400 km of rail tracks will be equipped across the rail network. This would mean that the ETCS will be equipped on 60% of the Czech rail network which ensure 98% of the traffic performance. According to the strategy, by 2040, the authorities also plan to install the digital system on the remaining 4,000 km of lines meaning that the entire railway network will be operational under the ETCS.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(336,'Railway PRO','Can a city fall in love with a tram?','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/can-a-city-fall-in-love-with-a-tram/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/skoda1-326x245.jpg','June 1, 2023','2023-09-20 17:03:57','Yes, it can. Just meet our design.\n \n\n \nThe character of a city is shaped by its public transportation system, which has an impact on both the impression tourists have of the city and the quality of life for local residents.\nVarious factors contribute to the design of vehicles, including technology, materials, safety considerations, and even climatic conditions or street width within the city. Additionally, numerous small details in the interiors play a role in enhancing passenger comfort, often without us being consciously aware of them.\nŠkoda Group vehicles are known for their high-quality design, and the group take pride in its ability to customize it to suit specific cities or customers in all of its projects. Follow along to learn more about the work of Škoda Group designers.\n \nCurrent trends in vehicle design\nIt is typical for means of transport that the development of new vehicles, their introduction to the market and their subsequent life spans a period of decades. Given the long lifetime, it is also desirable that proposals for design and styling are not subject to short-term trend.\nŠkoda Group designs its vehicles in line with the latest trends. Let’s examine some of the prominent trends that have influenced the production of trams and other vehicles presently operating on city streets or being newly introduced into service.\nUpon initial inspection, the dimensions of windshields have undergone changes, including the materials used. The objective is to provide drivers with an unobstructed view while ensuring that the consequences of a collision with a pedestrian are not fatal. Statistics on traffic accidents validate the value of these modifications.\nSafety-related changes also extend to the interior, which now features a more open layout and often incorporates camera surveillance. Less visible factors encompass the design of handrails and other interior elements, including the selection of materials. Passenger safety in unforeseen situations is receiving more attention than ever before.\nWhile the pursuit of practicality and ease of maintenance has always been crucial, in recent years, comfort and the overall driving experience have gained increasing importance. After all, the aim is to encourage individuals to switch from cars to more sustainable public transport. The most noteworthy change in recent times has been the transition to low-floor vehicle design, significantly enhancing the accessibility of public transport for passengers. The low floor also impacts the overall interior arrangement.\nThe materials used for seats have undergone significant evolution. Present-day trams feature plastic, wooden, and upholstered seats, often in combination. A design innovation is the offset double seat, deviating from the traditional side-by-side arrangement by a few centimetres. This seemingly minor feature enhances passenger comfort by avoiding tightness in the broadest part of the body, namely the shoulders.\nNoise is another comfort-related aspect under scrutiny. Numerous sub-changes, not immediately noticeable, have been implemented in the chassis or engine units. Consequently, modern trams are considerably quieter, both internally and externally, thanks to ingenious technical and design solutions.\nAll contemporary trams are equipped with electronic information panels, an array of intelligent sensors, and other electronic features, such as sockets or chargers. Twenty years ago, none of these existed – car doors opened mechanically, and the sole information system was a plastic sign displaying the names of the stops on the line. Simultaneously,     numerous   tram    systems   include passenger-unseen components, such as driving assistants that provide drivers with an additional set of eyes.\n \nA unique approach to design in Škoda Group\nDifferentiating itself from other manufacturers of public transport vehicles, Škoda Group employs a unique design approach. With a rich heritage, Škoda stands as one of the most established rolling stock manufacturers, exerting significant influence on public transport design not only in Europe but also globally. These vehicles embody a remarkable fusion of contemporary design and cutting- edge technologies, ensuring both safety and reliability.\nLeveraging their expertise, Škoda Group produce products capable of meeting the demands of modern and dynamic urban environments, synonymous with exceptional quality.\n \n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\n \nIn-house design excellence\nWhile collaborating with external design studios and universities focused on design, Škoda Group maintains a strong in-house design team, ensuring consistent design direction. In-house team comprises six industrial designers, each specializing in specific design domains. This specialization empowers the group to create sophisticated and innovative solutions that meet the exacting requirements of its customers. Working alongside larger teams of designers, engineers, and developers, the design team’s vision takes tangible form, blending unique perspectives and expertise for successful outcomes.\n \nTailored designs for custom projects\nVehicle acquisitions often come with significant costs, prompting manufacturers to adopt one-size-fits-all solutions that sacrifice individual client requirements. In contrast, Škoda vehicles are distinguished by their ability to seamlessly integrate into the overall cityscape. Designers meticulously analyse the city’s architecture and infrastructure, ensuring that Škoda vehicles not only function optimally but also align with the broader urban planning concept. From utilizing city-specific colour schemes to reflecting the built environment in their shape, designs harmonize with the city’s aesthetic and functional needs.\n \nTesting designs in real-world scenarios\nAt Škoda Group, a key priority lies in crafting vehicle designs that are both visually appealing and practical in everyday use. To achieve this, the teams of designers and engineers develop life-size models on which potential passengers, drivers, attendants, and other stakeholders can test the proposed solutions in realistic conditions. This invaluable feedback enables Škoda Group to refine designs, striving for maximum user-friendliness and efficiency. The most recent effort involved testing a sleeper cabin mock-up for Finland’s state operator VR, ensuring the optimal design for new night trains.\n \nUnifying Design Elements\nŠkoda designers concentrate on maintaining a cohesive visual style, characterized by clean lines, well-defined curves, and a confident expression throughout the rolling stock. A distinguishing feature of Škoda vehicles is the seamlessly integrated black mask that connects to the windscreen. This element elegantly houses the headlights and logo, providing a visually striking highlight. Despite variations in size, shape, and underlying technology among different vehicle types, this design element serves as a unifying visual touchpoint.\n \n\n \nA Glimpse into the Future\nWith the arrival of new technology, fresh opportunities are emerging in the design and development of vehicles for public transport. Factors that are not yet apparent to today’s passengers will increasingly shape the overall design and performance of vehicles.\nCutting-edge technologies are already exerting a significant influence on the design of public transport vehicles. Utilizing 3D printers offers improved insight into the suitability of proposed design solutions. Virtual reality enables the verification of design proposals at a 1:1 scale. Undoubtedly, these technologies will progressively become integral to the design process, for instance, facilitating communication with clients who will be able to navigate through their vehicle before its manufacturing. The shift towards autonomous vehicles is commonly associated with cars, but the same trend is also impacting public transport. In a few years, front cabs may become obsolete, and trams and trains will be operated in an entirely different manner.\nDesign of public transport vehicles is a vital aspect that leaves a lasting impact on cities, residents, and visitors. Škoda Group’s unique approach, with its emphasis on high- quality design tailored to specific cities and customers, sets a benchmark in the industry. By embracing current trends, leveraging advanced technologies, and looking toward the future, Škoda Group continues to shape the landscape of public transport design, enhancing the overall experience for passengers while contributing to the character and charm of cities worldwide.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(337,'Railway PRO','Systra wins São Paulo Line 22 design contract','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/systra-wins-sao-paulo-line-22-design-contract/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sao-Paulo-trainjpg-326x245.jpg','June 1, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:00','Systra Prime L22 consortium signed the contract to deliver preliminary engineering, architecture and geological studies for the São Paulo metro Line 22 (Brown Line) which will provide transport connection between the municipality of Cotia and the city of São Paulo.\nThe consortium should carry out the survey and develop the documents by May 2026.

To  meet global environmental policy objectives, it is imperative to develop sustainable transport systems that reduce CO2 emissions. When designing new transport systems, it is important to consider that they should not only be cost-effective and energy efficient for the future but also  boost economic growth and provide long-term benefits for the regions they serve.\n \n\n \nInvestment in transport infrastructure is a critical factor in boosting economic development in the CEE region. The development of high-speed railways and other key infrastructure projects, such as the Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK), Rail Baltica, and HSR development projects implemented by the Czech rail infrastructure manager Správa železnic will improve connectivity in North-East Europe, including Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Baltics, and Ukraine, with huge benefits for the CEE region, and Europe as a whole. By enhancing regional transportation systems, countries in the CEE region can attract more investment and create new opportunities for businesses and residents alike.\nThe Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK) is a comprehensive multimodal transport project based on three main pillars: an airport hub, a new rail network and an airport city. As a strategic infrastructure investment, CPK will effectively integrate air, rail and road transport, connecting nearly 180 million inhabitants in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) making Poland among the best-connected places in Europe and giving it the potential to become a strategic transport hub for the entire CEE region. The CPK railway investment includes the construction of approximately 2,000 km in new high-speed railway lines and several horizontal projects. They will create seamless, fast, and interoperable travel between major cities in Poland and improve the connectivity in the CEE region, making it more competitive against short-haul flights. CPK will also provide a significant boost to freight traffic capacities in the region, playing a crucial role in improving connectivity and enhancing economic growth in the CEE region.\n \nInvestment in the new transport system for Poland and Eastern Europe\nThe idea behind investing across the whole country is to create a comprehensive, integrated and sustainable transport system that will not only benefit Polish citizens but people across Central and Eastern Europe. The CPK project responds to the current and future needs of Poland and Europe. Together with investments in high-speed rail infrastructure, the CPK transport hub will provide efficient connections between major cities and regions in Poland, as well as with neighbouring countries. The high- speed railway line to Ukraine will play a critical role in linking Poland and Ukraine, improving trade and cultural exchange between our countries. By 2050, the completed high-speed rail network in the Three Seas region, suitable for both passenger and freight transport, will span approximately 4,500 km and the total cost of developing the entire HSR network in the Three Seas region should be around EUR 60 billion. These investments should provide significant benefits quickly, estimated to be close to EUR 120 billion. This means that, in the long term, the developed HSR network in the Three Seas region should generate twice the economic value compared to its initial cost.\n \nIntegrated railway network for both passenger and freight transport\nThe new CPK railway lines have been designed to accommodate both passenger and freight traffic. The passenger traffic will be served by high-speed trains while the freight trains will transport freight, for which speed and reliability are critical factors. To ensure efficient and reliable freight transport, CPK is prioritizing intermodal trains, particularly shuttle trains that operate on a fixed timetable at guaranteed time slots. This approach will provide greater flexibility for freight operators while ensuring that passenger services run on time and at high speed. The integration of both passenger and freight services will lead to a more sustainable and cost- effective transport system in the CEE region. Planning the locations for the intermodal terminals along CPK railway infrastructure is crucial for further developing the intermodal markets and achieving climate goals. These terminals will be designed to serve 750 m long trains and provide excellent connections to both rail and road networks, ensuring seamless and efficient transport of intermodal units – containers and semi-trailers.\nUpon completion, the CPK’s fast, frequent, and seamless railway infrastructure will comprehensively address numerous mobility needs in the region. It will deliver a direct connection to the CPK Airport from every major city in Poland via the high-speed rail network, linking the country’s largest cities with a travel time of under 2.5 hours. Finally, CPK will serve as a gateway to Eastern Europe, offering international routes covering the whole of Central and Eastern Europe while connecting Polish railways with neighbouring countries.\n\n \nThe CPK transport infrastructure as part of the revision of the TEN-T regulation\nIn December 2021, the European Commission published a draft of the new Trans-European Transport Network Regulation, which considers many of the Polish proposals for the revision of the network, including the investments covered by the CPK project. The most important changes from the point of view of CPK are related to the updated TEN-T network routes and the list of nodes. These include the airport infrastructure, i.e., CPK being included in the maps of the TEN-T core network, both as an airport and as a road-rail terminal, as well as the new railway infrastructure, which has been entrusted to CPK.\nThe high-speed railway line from Warsaw via CPK and Łódź to Poznań/Wrocław (so-called HSR ‘Y’ line), being part of the CPK project, is already included in the TEN-T core network under the current regulation. As part of the proposal, the EC confirmed the HSR ‘Y’ line is included in the TEN-T core network and a part of the ‘North Sea- Baltic Sea’ European Transport Corridor (ETC).\nThe Katowice-Ostrava railway line, known as ‘spoke’ no. 7, which is a new cross-border connection between Poland and the Czech Republic, has also been included in the extended TEN-T core network. This line will become part of the European Baltic-Adriatic corridor. The European Commission also included the Central Northern Rail Line in the category of projects for the extended core network with a high priority in the allocation of EU funds. It is an extension of the existing Central Rail Line to the north, to Warlubie, as part of the CPK’s planned ‘spoke’ no. 1. The route of the existing Central Rail Line and its planned extension by CPK runs along the Baltic-Adriatic Core Network corridor. Placing the line within the ETC indicates its high priority within the EU transport network. The line between Wrocław – Świdnica – Wałbrzych – and the Poland/Czech Republic border (and further towards Prague) remains on the TEN-T comprehensive network as a line with HSR parameters.\nIn the opinion of the European Commission, the key investments of CPK Poland should constitute priorities in the EU investment policy and their implementation should become Poland’s contribution to the European transport system.\n \nConnection of the Polish and European HSR networks with Ukraine\nThe development of the Poland-Ukraine HSR connection has been discussed for many years and was recently reflected in Ukraine’s Recovery Plan presented by Ukrainian authorities in Lugano on 4-5 July 2022, as well as in the EC proposal of 27 July 2022 on extending the European Transport Corridors (former TEN-T corridors) to Ukraine to develop a rail network with European gauge (1435 mm).\nTo tap into this opportunity, CPK proposes to extend the planned railway line: Lublin – Trawniki – Zamość – Bełżec\n– PL/UA border to Lviv and to include the cross-border section from Lublin to Lviv in the TEN-T core extended network and Baltic Sea – Black Sea – Aegean Sea European Transport Corridor as proposed in EC amended proposal of 27 July.\nThe proposed new line connecting Warsaw and Lviv could continue longitudinally through Ukraine (east of the Carpathian Mountains) towards Eastern Romania (Constanța port), as proposed by the EC on 27 July 2022. In the future, the line could also be extended from Lviv in European gauge (1435 mm) to Kyiv as part of the new Ukrainian HSR system connecting the country to the EU Member States.\nIn CPK’s view, such an extension would facilitate the development of a High-Speed Rail line connecting the EU and Ukraine at the same time linking Romanian Black Sea ports with Polish and Baltic countries’ seaports creating the shortest overland Black Sea – Baltic Sea connection, thus providing viable alternatives for Ukrainian export of goods, especially in the event of a blockade of the Black Sea, and facilitating military mobility in the region and on the NATO’s Eastern Flank.\n \n\n \nCPK: Pioneering Sustainable Mobility for a Greener Future\nInvesting in sustainable transport and green mobility is crucial in today’s world. Rail transportation plays a significant role, accounting for 8% of global passenger travel and approximately 9% of freight activity. Its remarkable efficiency sets rail apart, using only 3% of transport energy compared to other modes. According to the International Energy Agency, rail consumes 12 times less energy and emits 7 to 11 times fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per passenger per kilometre travelled when compared to private vehicles.\nCentralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK) project aligns perfectly with the EU Smart and Sustainably Mobility Strategy goals of enhancing passenger and freight rail services while promoting zero-emission transport on shorter routes and supporting multimodal transport solutions. The Three Seas region, encompassing multiple countries of Central and Eastern Europe, is determined to be a leader in climate-friendly, sustainable, and  resilient  transport.  By  developing a high-speed rail (HSR) network in the region, CPK significantly contributes to these objectives. But the benefits extend beyond environmental sustainability. The project’s positive impact on the economy, improved   transport   connections,   and a more sustainable future cannot be overstated. Enhanced rail infrastructure provides efficient and eco-friendly transportation options, reducing reliance on traditional modes that contribute to carbon emissions and traffic congestion. Investing in sustainable transport through projects like CPK paves the way for a greener and more connected future. By prioritizing rail development and embracing environmentally friendly solutions, we can create a smarter and more sustainable mobility system for generations to come.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(339,'Railway PRO','RailNetEurope and EU-Rail sign MoU','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/railneteurope-and-eu-rail-sign-mou/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RailNetEurope-EU-Rail-326x245.jpg','May 31, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:09','RailNetEurope (RNE) and the Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking (EU-Rail) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to foster an integrated, high-capacity European rail network by eliminating barriers to interoperability and building upon a harmonised functional system architecture shared by the sector.\nThe agreement was signed in Stockholm on 30 May 2023 during the Rail Transport Day and in the context of the Swedish Presidency of the European Union.\nThe collaboration facilitated by the agreement will cover traffic management and capacity allocation, exchange and communication of railway related data, infrastructure, and services, aiming to achieve higher railway sector efficiency, faster uptake and deployment of projects and innovations, and leverage the huge potential of digitalisation and automation to reduce rail’s costs, increase its capacity and enhance its flexibility and reliability.\nThe agreement is “important to Europe’s Rail as it creates an opportunity to collaborate on deeper level on topics related to infrastructure capacity allocation and rail traffic management, to foster crucial aspects of rail system transformation,” Giorgio Travaini, Executive Director a.i. at Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking, said.\nThe objective of the MoU is to ensure knowledge exchange and collaboration in three areas which are crucial for the European railway sector:\n\nEU-Rail System Pillar, following the mandate to develop a unified operational concept and a functional, safe and secure system architecture, as well as cooperation with the EU-Rail Flagship Areas, more specifically FA1 Network management planning and control and Mobility and FA5 Sustainable Competitive Digital Green Rail Freight Service;\nResearch and development of innovative solutions, including providing the necessary experience and sector engagement and ensuring that the concepts and designed solutions are interoperable and that legacy solutions can be migrated according to a clear migration strategy;\nOngoing sector initiatives in which also EU-Rail Members and RNE are involved, specifically digital infrastructure information, timetable redesign, digital capacity management, digital train information, including tracking and tracing, traffic management and IT architecture, among other\n\nThe agreement is “a further step in bringing key players in the European rail sector closer together.

For two other 125 km lines works involve electrification and revitalisation. This includes the 107 km Łuków – Lublin railway line and the Bieniów – Lubsko section which will be revitalised and will benefit from three new stops. In addition, two lines totalling 117 km will be reconstructed and/or extended. The 51 km Chełm – Włodawa section will be modernised to provide access to the Włodawa town and for the the 66 km Rejowiec – Zawada – Zamość Szopinek route works include modernisation and integration of the Zawada station.\nThe Kolej Plus programme is scheduled to be implemented by 2029, integrating the towns with poor or no access to rail services. PLN 13.2 billion (EUR 3 billion) is the value of the investment of the programme, of which the government will provide PLN 11.2 billion (EUR 2.5 billion) while PLN 2 billion (EUR 441 million) will be covered by the local or regional authorities.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(342,'Railway PRO','Parisians will be informed how crowded the next metro train is','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/parisians-will-be-informed-how-crowded-the-next-metro-train-is/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paris-GPE-326x245.jpg','May 30, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:27','Parisian metro rail company Transilien in Paris, France, is innovating with a new information service available on platform screens, namely how crowded the next metro train and carriages are.\n\nThis new service allows passengers to check the crowding on board trains and carriages and to position themselves so that they board a less busy carriage. This service has been progressively implemented since the beginning of the year on lines equipped with trains that have sensors above the doors that count the number of passengers boarding and leaving the train at each stop.\nPassengers on the N, H, L and J lines now have this information on service screens located on the platforms and will be rolled out on the P, K, R and some RER E stations by the end of June.\nCongestion counters on the next metro train\nThis information is also available on transilien.com on all lines equipped with trains with door counters.\nCar crowding information is also available on transilien.com The level of carriage crowding is also available on the transilien.com website in the sections Route search and Next departures, for trains currently running on lines equipped with door sensor equipment, i.e. on H, J, K, L, N, P, R and partly on RER E.\nTrains compatible with this service are equipped with infrared sensors above each door. They count the number of passengers entering and leaving the train at each station. By comparing these figures with the capacity of the train, it becomes possible to calculate the occupancy rate of the train. When the train leaves a station, it transmits this counting information in real time to Transilien’s computer systems, making it possible to update the occupancy display at the next 4 stations.\nThe train’s occupancy is displayed on the platform at three levels of inflow/occupancy. The French consider that information on how crowded Transilien trains has become a major expectation regularly expressed by passengers since the COVID epidemic.\nOver 75% of passengers on all Transilien lines expressed satisfaction with this feature. The main advantages are: being able to choose a less crowded train when you can easily adapt your timetable or when you are loaded, when you have to travel seated or even knowing what to expect.\nControlled passenger numbers, well evened out between trains and within the same train, is also a way to improve regularity. Better passenger distribution avoids ‘traffic blocks’ in certain areas, for example at the head or tail of trains to be closer to the exit. Knowing in advance that one part of the train is already full while another is lightly used will encourage passengers to stretch out and make the journey more pleasant for everyone.\nThe flow of passengers getting on and off the train will be quicker, so the train will depart faster at the next stop. Finally, a final positive point cited by passengers interviewed is limiting pushing and crowding during peak times, which can be particularly difficult for frail people.\nExcavation completed for one tunnel of Paris metro line 16\n\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(343,'Railway PRO','European Sleeper begins its journey from Brussels to Berlin','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/european-sleeper-begins-its-journey-from-brussels-to-berlin/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/European-Sleeper-326x245.jpg','May 30, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:31','The founders of European Sleeper, Elmer van Buuren and Chris Engelsman, and the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Georges Gilkinet, have launched the first Brussels – Berlin sleeper service in a ceremony held on 26 May 2023 in Brussel Zuid station.\nThe train service runs from Brussels via Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam towards Berlin on a 12-hour journey. The train leaves Brussel Zuid station on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 19:22 and arrives at Berlin Hauptbahnhof on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 06:48. The return journey takes 9 hours with train departing Berlin at 22:56 on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday and arriving in Brussels at 09:27 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\nThe most comfortable travel option provides a maximum of 3 beds in the compartment, the comfort class provides passengers with 6 couchettes at night and seats during the day. The most affordable travel option provides 6 seats in a compartment which can also be booked as a private compartment, but not between the Netherlands and Belgium.\nThe operator intends introduce a new train service every year, from spring 2024 expecting to expand the service from Berlin to Dresden and Prague, in the Czech Republic.\nOn 22nd May, European Sleeper performed a test train ride with its partners, investors and the team.\nFor European Sleeper, the introduction of this service is an important first step in building a more extensive network of sleeper trains from Belgium and the Netherlands. In recent months, the availability of sleeper carriages has proved the greatest challenge. The service between Brussels and Berlin will start with hired carriages, but European Sleeper will soon be investing in its own carriages with even more comfort, a modern feel and more privacy options.\nThe new sleeper service between Brussels and Berlin is not just relevant for the cities on the route. Thanks to the sleeper service, other attractive options to travel by train come into play as well, for example between London and Berlin (change in Brussels to the Eurostar), Paris and Berlin (change in Brussels to the Thalys), Brussels and Warsaw (change in Berlin to the EuroCity).\n“The European Sleeper demonstrates that demand for long-distance cross-border passenger rail, including night trains, is growing fast, and that such services can be operated in a commercially viable Open Access manner,” AllRail says highlighting that tit is the first independently owned scheduled long-distance rail operator to depart from Belgium and its new night train is commercially driven – not a Public Service Obligation (PSO) – and links Belgium, the Netherlands with Berlin in Germany.\nEuropean Sleeper is a new Dutch-Belgian rail company focusing on sleeper trains and is part of the movement which is putting the sleeper train in Europe back on the map. “More and more people will abandon planes, cars or buses and board the sleeper train to be transported to new places as they sleep,” the company says.\nAt the end of May 2021, European Sleeper had raised EUR 500,000 in starting capital within three months by selling shares to over 350 small investors from various countries in Europe\nand beyond. In 2022, EUR 2 million in shares were sold which has created an enthusiastic community, involved in the development of the business.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(344,'Railway PRO','Former head of OSE and two other directors indicted for Greek train crash','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/former-head-of-ose-and-two-other-directors-indicted-for-greek-train-crash/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Greece-326x245.jpg','May 30, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:36','The former chairman of the state-owned Spiros Pateras and two other directors have been charged in connection with the February Greek train crash that killed 57 people.\nThe three have been charged with breaching their official duties for giving the job of head of Larisa station, where the accident occurred, to a railway employee who did not meet the necessary conditions for the job.\nThe employee, who was also charged, admitted in court that he had shunted a passenger train on the same line as an oncoming freight train, with which he ended up colliding. Given that Larisa station is a hotspot on the Greek rail network, one of the conditions for getting the job was that the occupant should be no more than 48 years old, 11 years younger than the age of the person who got the job.\nUnder Greece’s penal code, the offence of breach of duty by a civil servant is punishable by up to two years in prison. The former head of Larisa station is in pre-trial detention on charges of “negligent homicide” and other offences which could carry a sentence of between ten years and life imprisonment if convicted.\nGreece train crash leaves 57 dead\nThe rail disaster occurred on the night of 28 February when a passenger train collided head-on with a freight train north of the town of Larisa, killing 57 people, mostly students. Thousands of Greeks took to the streets after the accident to demand punishment, and protests ended in clashes with police.\nAt the time, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised to the families of the victims. “As Prime Minister, I owe you all, but especially the relatives of the victims, an apology. In the Greece of 2023, it is not possible for two trains to run in opposite directions on the same line and for no one to notice,” the prime minister wrote in a message on his official Facebook account.\nHellenic Train has announced that it will compensate each family of the 57 passengers killed in the train crash in Greece on 28 February with an “advance payment” of EUR 42,000.\nInjured passengers will receive compensation of between EUR 5,000 and EUR 10,000, depending on their injuries and the length of hospitalisation, the company announced. Hellenic Train, the Greek rail operator owned by Italian state-owned Ferrovie Dello Stato Italiane (FS), said the compensation “does not in any way constitute an acceptance of liability on the part of the company” under the EU regulation. The Greek government has already announced that it will compensate each family that has lost a loved one in the accident with a monthly pension of EUR 1,600 and forgiveness of debts to the state.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(345,'Railway PRO','Ukrzaliznytsia obtains WB grant for rail infrastructure','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/ukrzaliznytsia-obtains-wb-grant-for-rail-infrastructure/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ukraine-UNOPS-agreement-326x245.jpg','May 30, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:40','The World Bank will provide a USD 25 million grant to support the reconstruction of Ukrainian railway infrastructure and the increase of freight transport, Ukrzaliznytsia has announced on May 26, 2023, following a cooperation agreement signed with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in Kyiv.\n“Ukrzaliznytsia is expanding its portfolio of cooperation with international institutions. For the first time, we have financial support from the World Bank, and with this grant funding, we expect to supply equipment and rolling stock already this year. I am sure that the implementation of this project will allow us to expand our partnership to further strategically important projects for Ukrainian railway infrastructure,” Anton Mishin, a member of the board of Ukrzaliznytsia said.\nThe agreement between UNOPS and the Ukrainian Railways provides for the purchase of equipment for the restoration of critically important railway infrastructure facilities that have suffered damage. UNOPS will contribute to the organisation of procurement procedures according to the best global standards. Through the procurement of flat wagons, the company’s freight fleet will increase and will contribute to the expansion of the capacity to provide containerised transport services, including for transport of humanitarian aid and export of agricultural products.\n“The railway connection is of exceptional importance for the economy of Ukraine both now and in the context of post-war reconstruction. As the central resource of the UN system in matters of procurement and infrastructure development, UNOPS considers it a priority to provide assistance to the national railway carrier, because this will facilitate the population’s access to necessary goods, create new opportunities for enterprises and strengthen the resilience of the whole world in the face of new challenges,” the Director of the Office UNOPS in Ukraine Tim Lardner said.\nIn February 2023, the World Bank announced a USD 50 million grant financing for a project to repair and restore Ukraine’s transport network to support immediate humanitarian relief and recovery, and increase capacity of import and export corridors. The financing for the project is provided by the Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF), with additional funding of up to USD 535 million. This was the second scalable World Bank supported emergency operation approved at the end of 2022 and beginning of 2023 that mobilises partner resources through an innovative framework approach.  The first one was approved in December and focuses on repairing health infrastructure and health services.\nThe Repairing Essential Logistics Infrastructure and Network Connectivity (RELINC) project supports the restauration of essential bridges and railways to reconnect the communities and improve westward transport linkages to mitigate impacts of Black Sea shipping disruptions. The project covered the purchase of modular bridges, equipment, and materials to urgently repair damaged road-to-bridge connections and vital rail lines. It also helps to finance the purchase of flatbed wagons and additional rolling stock to expand the railway’s capacity to move cargo in containers.\nAccording to an analysis of World Bank, more than 2,100 villages, 51 towns, and 35 cities in areas that have returned to Government of Ukraine control are experiencing disrupted transport networks due to war. Direct damage to Ukraine’s transport network is extensive totaling more than USD 29.9 billion and economic losses from disrupted transport total an additional USD 26.1 billion as of June 1, 2022. Since February 2022, working with development partners, the World Bank has mobilised more than USD 34 billion in financial support to Ukraine, of which over USD 21 billion has been disbursed. The investment supports and is part of the World Bank’s contribution to the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes initiative. The project will better align Ukraine’s rail lines to EU logistics chains and support agricultural exports through EU ports.\nOn May 16, 2023, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) handed over 105 diesel generators worth USD 2.7 million to Ukrzaliznytsia. The funding helps Ukrainian Railways to provide back-up electricity supply to more than 100,000 consumers and contributes to the smooth transport of passengers and cargo within Ukraine.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe 45% of the 20,000 km Ukrainian railway infrastructure is electrified and the generators provided by USAID are installed at key stations on the main passenger and freight train routes. Thus, “the generators provide a safe back-up power supply for traction substations, signalling and telecommunication devices and maintain uninterrupted operation and technological communication with adjacent operators of the distribution system,” Oleksandr Kubrakov, the Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine said at the reception. Through the USAID, the US government provided Ukraine more than 3,300 generators since Russia’s war against Ukraine. Generators ensure the power supply for more than 100,000 consumers and facilitate uninterrupted freight and passenger services.\nBetter integration for freight services and infrastructure\nIn 2022, Lithuania’s LTG Cargo has started a pilot train from Kaunas Intermodal Terminal to Ukraine via Poland, bypassing Belarus. LTG Cargo ensured the cargo transport along the route in Lithuania, while its subsidiary LTG Cargo Polska delivered transport services from Ukraine to Poland border.\nIn May 2023, Ukrzaliznytsia and VTG GmbH signed cooperation agreement aiming at the development of intermodal connections between Ukraine and European countries, providing rhythmicity, predicted time and cost of transport services. At the beginning of 2023, Ukrzaliznytsia introduced an intermodal service for containers, combining semi-trailers, container and combined transport trains using the rolling stock from the Liski Transport Service Centre branch. The company announced that is exploring similar services to Poland, Austria, Romania and Turkey.\nUnder the company’s plans, an agreement was signed with ÖBB Rail Cargo Group (RCG) in May to organize intermodal services on Vienna–Kyiv route through RCG’s TransFER. The new service will stop in Budapest and Lviv delivering better connected and fast services.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nDuring transport logistic 2023 trade fair held in Munich, Ukrzaliznytsia and Tria discussed on the possibility of the introduction of technological solutions especially the variable gauge system allowing smooth transition from 1520mm tracks to European-gauge lines. An expert group is expected to be established to assess the prospects of introducing this technology. In addition, talks have been held between Ukrzaliznytsia and PKP Cargo, EP Logistics and Slovenian Railways on facilitating rail transport services. Lithuanian Railways and Laude Smart Intermodal signed agreements with Ukrzaliznytsia to jointly implement the “FREE Rail Operating Model” project which is designed to increase transport capacity and offer a better interoperability between the European and Ukrainian railway infrastructure.\nThe parties will create a single independent system of railway operation on the 1520 mm network from the point of view of technical standards, IT systems, regulations or any type of certification. It is also planned to develop alternative transport corridors between the ports of the Baltic Sea and Ukraine, bypassing Russia and Belarus.\nUnder the agreement with Polish Laude Smart Intermodal company, the parties will identify methods and ways to develop intermodal solutions, bulk cargo services and rolling stock management and maintenance. This will improve rail logistics services and strength the exchange of know-how and practical experience.\nRegarding a better integration with the EU’s rail system, in October 2022, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission announced that a pre-feasibility study will be developed to connect the rail networks of Ukraine and Moldova and integrate them into the TEN-T. In addition, the EC made an amendment on the revision of the TEN-T Regulation to extend the European corridors (ETCs) to the two non-EU countries including Mariupol and Odesa ports which will improve rail connectivity and integration.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(346,'Railway PRO','New Zealand commits investment for rail projects','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/new-zealand-commits-investment-for-rail-projects/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KiwiRail-infra-works-326x245.jpg','May 30, 2023','2023-09-20 17:04:44','Kiwi Rail has announced that the 2023 budget will provide an investment of NZD 569.2 million (USD 345.8 million) to be used to upgrade, modernise and improve resilience of New Zealand rail infrastructure, while plans investigating the electrification of more lines continue.\nNZD 359.2 million (USD 218.2 million) will be used to deliver the rail network investment programme.  “The Government’s changes to funding rail infrastructure, using the same mechanism that pays for roads through the National Land Transport Fund, is creating certainty that allows KiwiRail to properly carry out network upgrades and improvements across the national rail network,” KiwiRail Chief Executive Peter Reidy said.\nInitially, the funding plans were designed as an annual funding mechanism and shifting to a “long-term funding programme as we now have, means KiwiRail is better able to plan, manage costs and recruit the staff to carry out the crucial work that will lift our national railway to a reliable and resilient standard,” Peter Reidy underlined.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nUp to NZD 200 million (USD 121.5 million) will ensure KiwiRail can get on with rebuilding North Island rail lines, damaged in extreme weather events and make those lines more resilient. This investment will strengthen New Zealand rail infrastructure damaged in January, when Cyclone Gabrielle hit the country. The lines in Hawke’s Bay region, on the eastern coast, and Northland and Auckland metro network were badly damaged. Through the government’s funding “we will be able to do some targeted investment in the affected regions to build back better, making damaged areas stronger, but also replacing some old assets so that the rail lines are more resilient to future weather events,” Peter Reidy said.\nIn April, KiwiRail reopened the railway line to Hastings and by the end of this year the line to Napier is planned to be reopened. Works are also implemented on the Napier – Wairoa line and on the Swanson – Whangārei section in Northland. We are trying to get the lines open is quickly as possible, but the sheer scale of the damage and issues with slope stability means it will take time,” company’s Chief Executive explained.\nThe financing also provides NZD 10 million (USD 6 million) for further rail electrification in the North Island used to a detailed business case stage, with initial design and engineering to scope the work, enabling funding on major decisions to be considered within this decade. Works to extend the electrification of Auckland network from Papakura to Pukekohe are proceeding and the latest funding will be used for planning the electrification of North Island rail lines such as the Golden Triangle (the Tauranga – Hamilton – Auckland route) which ensures half of all rail freight transport in New Zealand. Electrification plans also include the main North Island rail line, between Palmerston North and Wellington.

USD 1.49 million is the the cost of the first phase, referred to as pre-construction services. The project is funded by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority Measure B Programme and the City of Mountain View, in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe project will improve safety and multimodal access to the transit centre and Downtown Mountain View and is focused on the Castro Street / Moffett Boulevard / Central Expressway intersection and will close the Castro Street crossing of the rail tracks. A shared use pathway that allows pedestrians and cyclists to pass under the tracks and Central Expressway will offer safe and easy access to residents and office workers to Mountain View’s vibrant downtown.\nThe City of Mountain View identified this project as phase I of the 2017 Transit Master Plan. Determinations will be made this year regarding the architectural design and public art that will be featured, with the final design scheduled to be completed in the summer 2024 when works will also start. The construction is expected to be completed in late 2026.\nThis awarded contract follows an earlier action to authorise the use of CM / GC for the project, as opposed to conventional design-bid-build project delivery. There are advantages to the CM / GC delivery which engages the contractor earlier in the project. This is Caltrain’s first use of CM / GC project delivery, and is a key strategy being deployed by Caltrain’s Design and Construction team in expanding the pallet of project delivery methods being utilised to increased schedule and cost certainty, particularly on large, complex projects.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nCreating a grade separation at Castro Street so people and vehicles will no longer be required to cross the tracks will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists, reduce train gate down-time and horn noise, reduce conflicts between trains, vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclist, and improve traffic flow.\nThe other project involves the Bayshore station overpass rehabilitation that has moved into the final phase of construction which will end this summer. The project will remove and replace the coating on the station’s pedestrian bridge and stairwells to ensure the overpass remains safe and fully functional. The elevators, stairs and walkway overpass will remain closed to pedestrian traffic during construction.\nThe USD 6.87 million project began in September 2022 and is made possible through a combination of state and San Francisco Prop K funds.\nThe 27 Caltrain stations are providing connection on the 82 km rail corridor between San Francisco Peninsula, through the South Bay to San Jose and Gilroy. Part of infrastructure, at 17 Caltrain stations foundations have been completed while works are underway covering for poles, wires and traction power system.\nIn September 2022, Caltrain unveiled the new electric trains which currently are being tested and in 2024 will enter passenger operation, replacing the replace the 30-year-old diesel fleet. This is part of Caltrain electrification project of the entire corridor from San Francisco Caltrain station to the Tamien Caltrain station (in San Jose), increasing service to six trains per peak hour per direction, and maintaining operating speed up to 127 km/h.\nUSD 2.44 billion is the total value of the project, of which USD 1.75 billion represents the electrification works and USD 693.5 million the rolling stock procurement signed with Stadler which includes one demonstration project for a battery electric trainset which will enable Caltrain to pilot a technology that could provide zero emissions service from Tamien to Gilroy and Salinas on UPRR owned line. Caltrain is engaged in discussion with the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) on funding this demonstration train. The contract provides for an option for Caltrain to order six BEMUs expected to cost between USD 70 – 80 million.

The pilot train has operating on the Chengdu Line 7.\nThe demonstration train was the first to introduce a ground-breaking traction system in China that combined both a complete silicon carbide traction converter and a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The project’s successful completion marks the beginning of a new chapter in energy conservation in the rail transit industry and is solid evidence that Alstom has contributed to the high-quality growth of China’s green and intelligent rail transit integration.\nThe new generation silicon carbide and permanent magnet motor propulsion system of Alstom NUG Propulsion System adopts advanced technologies such as silicon carbide power devices with high-frequency, high-junction temperature, and low loss, as well as innovative technology of high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous motors.\nThanks to the use of SIC and PMM technologies, 30% of energy is saved for train traction. On the other hand, during the design phase of the new converter, special attention was given to maintaining a similar level of reliability, while going from car control to single axle control. The maintainability is increased by adequate design of the new converter. This significantly makes maintenance operations more convenient. In addition, this product features lightweight and significantly reduced noise index, satisfying customer demands for environmental friendliness, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.\nBased on this, ANP’s new generation of silicon carbide and permanent magnet motor traction system has five major innovation points:\n\nhigh frequency, miniaturisation, and low loss axis controlled full SIC power inverter module; high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous traction motor;\nnew generation of high-reliability control units and new digital gate drivers;\nspeed sensorless control technology for permanent magnet motors;\nmore energy-efficient and noise reducing cooling system.\n\nPrior to this, a 20-year joint venture extension agreement was reached between Alstom and New United Group, regarding ANP with the purpose of further developing their pragmatic partnership. The fact that this pilot train with traction system was completed successfully is a strong indication of the two sides’ growing collaboration. Together with its Chinese joint ventures, Alstom will continue to provide complete and independent service to the Chinese rail transit market. It will also use cutting-edge technologies and procedures to enable China’s rail transit to enter a new era of sustainability, intelligence, and low-carbon transport.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(354,'Railway PRO','Contractor selected for Bergamo T2 tram line','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/contractor-selected-for-bergamo-t2-tram-line/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bergamo-T2-trams-326x245.jpg','May 29, 2023','2023-09-20 17:05:27','A consortium of Impresa Milesi geom.

The assignment passed with a resolution of the Board of Directors of TEB, Bergamo tram operator, which formally awarded EUR 176.3 million contract.\nThe consortium will have to complete the design within 5 months from contract signing and the construction works are expected to start before the end of 2023.\nThe Bergamo T2 tram line will be 11.5 km long and will be served by 17 new stops, and two existing ones (Borgo Palazzo and San Fermo). T2 line will cross five municipalities with nine stations to be constructed in Bergamo, and in Ponteranica, Sorisole, Almè and Villa d’Almè will benefit two stations each. From the new Bronzetti stop, the interchange between the two tram lines, the T2 continues north-west along the route of the former Ferrovia della Valle Brembana (FVB), abandoned in 1966. In addition, the project provides for the preparation of two further stops, in connection with the urban redevelopment interventions in the areas of the former Reggiani in Bergamo and Gres in Sorisole.\n95% of the line will be a dedicated route and will have 32 level crossings between roads and pedestrians. The entire layout is double-track with the exception of the already existing Ramera tunnel, near the future Ponteranica stop, and the historic bridge over Rino River in Villa d’Almè. In Bergamo, a tunnel (Pontesecco), overpasses and underpasses will be built to allow trams to continue along the route.\n“We are facing the final stages of a complex process, which has had to deal with unforeseen instances, such as the significant increase in the cost of raw materials and the arrival of new regulations. We also wanted to listen to and follow up as much as possible on the requests of the municipal administrations affected by the new line and this required a further coordination and planning effort which was carried out with great professionalism by the whole company,” Filippo Simonetti, the president of TEB said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe technical-economic feasibility for the line has been developed by TEB in December 2018 and one year later, the project has been selected and funded by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport.\nEUR 211 million is the total investment, EUR 151.5 million being the co-financing of Lombardy Region, EUR 9.5 million from Municipality and Province of Bergamo and EUR 4 million from the other Municipalities involved in the route. EUR 3 million is the financing of Consorzio B.I.M. del Lago di Como, Brembo e Serio with whom the agreement was signed in December 2021.\nThe final phase of project’s documentation was carried out by the RTI Tramsì consortium compriding Italferr, E.T.S., SDA Progetti and Ing Arini. Belloni provided design and architectural consultancy services and the procedures for expropriation and the public consultation is currently underway.\nJourney time between Bergamo to Villa d’Almè is estimated at 30 minutes. For the line, 10 32-metre-long tramways will be delivered with a maximum capacity for 239 passengers, similar to the existing vehicles, which complement the 14 trams on Line T1. Thus, a total fleet of 24 trams will be able to run on both lines at a maximum speed of 70 km/h. In the more urbanised stretch between Ponteranica and Bergamo the tramways will run at 50 km/h.\nThe vehicles will be served at the new depot build near the Petosino and the Operational Control Centyre of Ranica, situated on T1 Line will be responsible for the traffic management on the both lines (T1 and T2).\nBergamo T2 tram line is expected to be opened in September 2026. “The launch of the new tramway line will be an opportunity to rethink the entire public transport system in the Bergamo area,” Gianni Scarfone, CEO of TEB.\nTEB expects that in rush hour with trams 82% occupied, 15,064 passengers per day will use the new service with trams travelling 1,700 km each day, for a total of 500,000 km per year. According to TEB, the line will be annually used by 4.1 – 4.5 million passengers which will benefit integrated public transport services with the bus lines in the 30 municipalities around the capital and with the extra-urban area of the Brembana and Imagna Valleys.\nThe line will also benefit interchange parking lots with 515 parking spaces in total and almost a one km  cycle and pedestrian path which has been used since the railway line was closed.

The line will be operated by 40 trains per hour per direction.\nIn 2019, the City Municipality and six communes have signed an agreement to develop a feasibility study on the metro system, and one year later, a EUR 7.4 million contract has been signed with a consortium of SWS Engineering, Systra and Metrans Engineering to deliver the feasibility studies for Cluj metro system and the suburban train network.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(359,'Railway PRO','Manchester appoints DB to deliver tram safety programme','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/manchester-appoints-db-to-deliver-tram-safety-programme/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Manchester-tram-326x245.jpg','May 25, 2023','2023-09-20 17:05:51','Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) appointed DB ESG, the UK representative of Deutsche Bahn consultancy and engineering service unit, to deliver the tram safety improvement programme.\nUnder the contract, DB ESG will work in partnership with Sella Controls, and will design, install, test and commission the Driver Vigilance Devices (DVD) and Tram Overspeed Protection Systems (TOPS) to the Metrolink fleet of trams.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) recommended that light rail networks deliver programmes to prevent the risk of serious accidents from tram over-speeding or driver inattention following the tragic event at Sandilands in Croydon where a tram overturned.\nMetrolink trams are already fitted with a device that applies the emergency brake in the event of a driver becoming incapacitated and the signalling system has several built-in protections.\nTo prevent over-speeding, Metrolink’s fleet of 147 trams will be equipped with the new systems that will use GPS and other information to determine the location and speed of the tram.\nThe system utilises Sella Controls UK Rail approved Tracklink III and EKE Electronics TRAINNET technologies to provide the TOPS and DVD System. In the event of over-speeding, the driver will be alerted, and if there is no response the brakes will be applied automatically. The protection system will operate independently of other tram monitoring systems. To ensure drivers remain alert, an upgrade will be applied to the traction brake system and if no movement is detected input will be requested from the driver.\nSince the Croydon accident, TfGM and the Metrolink operator KeolisAmey Metrolink (KAM), worked to progress the recommendations and introduced enhancements such as lower speed limits in key areas, additional hazard signage, an improved driver simulator used for training, enhanced medical standards and proactive speed monitoring.\n“The safety of our customers and staff is paramount, which is why we have robust safety and assurance practices built into the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the network,” TfGM’s Head of Metrolink, Danny Vaughan, said.\nThe tram safety improvement programme will be applied to the UK’s largest light rail network, with more than 100 km of track and 147 vehicles, which equates to just under half (46%) of the entire tram fleet in the UK. Significant work has been done to explore new technology that will help to deliver the more complicated RAIB recommendations. This included the use of the Metrolink network to trial solutions on behalf of the newly founded Light Rail Safety and Standards Board. This research was used to develop the specifications for the systems that DB ESG will now deliver.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(360,'Railway PRO','Contract awarded to quadruple Milan-Genoa line section','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/contract-awarded-to-quadruple-milan-genoa-line-section/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Milano-Rogoredo-Pavia-326x245.jpg','May 25, 2023','2023-09-20 17:06:00','Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) awarded a EUR 189 million contract for construction works to quadruple the Milan – Pavia railway section which is financed by Italy’s recovery and resilience plan and is expected to be completed in 2026.\nThe consortium of D’Agostino Angelo Antonio Costruzioni Generali and SE.GE.CO won the design and construction contract.\nThe project consists of the construction of an 11 km double track and interventions to speed up the existing tracks for a total length of approximately 29 km. The new Pieve Emanuele station will be activated, new stops and a new electrical substation will be built, and the sidewalks of the Villamaggiore stop and the existing works will be adapted.\nThe intervention is divided into two functional phases. The first phase involves the quadrupling of the Milan Rogoredo – Pieve Emanuele section (about 11 km), while the second phase concerns the completion of works up to Pavia, of about 18 km.\nQuadrupling the Milan – Pavia railway line will allow the increase of train numbers for both freight and passengers and will enhance the regional and suburban transport service and will also unblock the works on north – south connectivity.\nIt is estimated that the number of trains will double from 10 trains per hour per direction to 20 trains per hour per.\nThe quadrupling of the tracks between Milan Rogoredo and Pieve Emanuele, on the Milan – Pavia rail section, is part of Milan – Genoa rail project and together with the completion of the works at the Genoa node and the Terzo Valico dei Giovi represents another important step to bring Genoa and Milan closer together. The goal is to steadily reduce travel times between the cities to under an hour.\nThe Terzo Valico dei Giovi – Genova Junction high-capacity line will provide unprecedented connection in the Northern Italy as it will allow the Ligurian capital to be connected first with Milan, then with the European TEN-T network, towards Rotterdam. The project covers the construction of 53 km of line of which 27 km will be constructed in tunnel (Valico Tunnel) and 3 new stations with an estimated value of EUR 7.7 billion. The tunnel’s tracks have a total length of 90 km if all secondary line interconnections are considered.

The regulation now includes railway transport, a “a key missing element not foreseen in the European Commission’s proposal. This will encourage member states to consider the roll-out of alternative fuels infrastructure on the rail network, contributing to the achievement of the EU Green Deal objectives,” the European Rail Supply Industry (UNIFE) and the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies (CER) say.\n“The development of alternative fuel technologies is also important for railways, where direct electrification of a section is not possible for reasons such as for cost-efficiency of the service. Different technologies are available to the rail sector to shift away from diesel trains, including direct electrification, battery powered trains and hydrogen applications. The development of these technologies requires the deployment of suitable recharging and refuelling infrastructure in member states,” the regulation says.\nWelcoming the conclusion and outcome of the negotiations of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation, UNIFE and CER consider the inclusion of rail under the document’s scope to be a step in the right direction, in particular due to the relevant rail related provisions.\nThe regulation says that the member states shall assess the development of alternative fuel technologies and propulsion systems for rail sections that cannot be fully electrified for technical or cost-efficiency reasons, such as hydrogen or battery-electric train and, if relevant, any refuelling and recharging infrastructure needs.\nBy 1 January 2025, each member state shall prepare and send to the Commission a draft national policy framework for the development of the market as regards alternative fuels in the transport sector and the deployment of the relevant infrastructure. Thus, on rail transport, the national policy framework shall contain an overview of the state of play, perspectives, and planned initiatives for deployment of infrastructure including targets, key milestones and financing needed, for hydrogen or battery electric trains on network segments that cannot be electrified.\nPart of the regulation, the European Commission will issue recommendations on each member state final national policy framework and if the member state concerned does not address a recommendation or a substantial part thereof, it shall provide a written explanation to the Commission.\n“AFIR therefore sets an appropriate regulatory framework to sustain the investments made by railway suppliers, operators and infrastructure managers alike in innovative alternatives to diesel, facilitating European technology leadership in this domain,” UNIFE and CER conclude in a joint press release.\nThe European rail industry is “pleased to see that EU institutions, in particular thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament, have finally included rail in the scope of AFIR. Even though the level of ambition could have been higher, the Regulation will create an important incentive and visibility for the industry to continue its investments in developing competitive alternatives to diesel on lines that will not be electrified,” UNIFE Director-General Philippe Citroën said.\n“The European railway and infrastructure companies look forward to national plans to deploy alternative fuels to rail. In the short-run, however, rail’s operating costs and in particular electricity costs need to be carefully assessed, and in today’s situation support measures are needed to make sure that rail’s intermodal competitiveness is not hampered and that a shift to diesel traction is avoided,” CER Executive-Director Alberto Mazzola said.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(362,'Railway PRO','Pesa launches first hydrogen shunting locomotive approved for the EU','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/pesa-launches-first-hydrogen-shunting-locomotive-approved-for-the-eu/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Locomotiva-PESA-H2-696x417-1-326x245.jpeg','May 24, 2023','2023-09-20 17:06:09','Pesa – Poland’s largest rolling stock manufacturer – has introduced the first certified hydrogen shunting locomotive to be approved for the European market.\n\nHydrogen shunting locomotive with passed tests\nThe ability to offer a commercially ready vehicle with a mobile refuelling infrastructure was a key criterion in Pesa’s development approach. The SM42-6Dn locomotive passed preliminary operational tests at Pesa’s facility in Bydgoszcz, Poland, in August 2022, before being unveiled alongside a mobile refuelling station at InnoTrans a month later.\nRailway Institute certification tests were completed in December, ahead of anticipated final approval in the first half of 2023. The 70t locomotive is focused on shunting and driving light freight trains, with a maximum speed of 90 km/h at an ambient temperature of -25°C to +35°C. The model is a hydrogen-based upgrade of Pesa’s SM42 class of shunting locomotives and represents the first phase of the company’s programme to implement zero-emission technologies in rail vehicles.\nPesa aims to use the experience gained from this project to inform its construction of a hydrogen-powered passenger train – with an initial prototype scheduled for 2025. Pesa’s locomotive is powered by two robust 85 kW proton exchange membrane (PEM) modules from Ballard – proven in heavy-duty zero-emission engine applications. The hydrogen-powered unit offers a low-risk, versatile and easy-to-install solution for system integrators, providing the route flexibility, range and maximum speeds demanded by industry operators. “Hydrogen technologies in rail transport are constantly developing and maturing, and Pesa’s continued deployment of zero-emission rail vehicles confirms our competence, expertise and level of innovation – and sets us apart as a leader in this space. Our ambition to accelerate industry-wide decarbonisation is shared by Ballard, whose robust fuel cell platform provides a durable, high-performance power module for the heavy-duty SM42-6Dn application – making Polish railways a significant step closer to a clean, comfortable and environmentally friendly future,” Maciej GrześkowiakDirector of Strategic Projects and Communications, Pesa, said.\nBallard’s modular fuel cell design allows for flexible integration of components into the vehicle’s propulsion system, provides better performance, fuel efficiency and endurance by preventing fuel cell unit degradation, and Ballard’s proven performance and reliability is demonstrated by the module’s exceptional availability and lifetime – well over 30,000 hours of fuel cell operation in the field without failure.\nOben Uluc, Sales and Commercial Director, EMEA, Ballard, said, “Ballard customers understand the importance of adopting zero-emission energy to keep pace with the industry, as well as identifying key collaborators to work with (…) The supply of our robust and durable fuel cell module to PESA’s hydrogen locomotive demonstrates Ballard’s proven market experience, our performance in delivering pioneering vehicle fuel cell energy and the promise of comprehensive customer support for mission-critical solutions.”\nFinal type approval testing was completed after a special mobile hydrogen refuelling station was built in partnership with PESA’s fuel and energy collaborator, PKN ORLEN, on an experimental line in Płock, Poland, to ensure that all dynamic tests could be carried out efficiently.\nPesa and PKN ORLEN plan to commission the zero-emission SM42-6Dn locomotive in the first quarter of 2023 and have signed a collaboration agreement that will allow the locomotive and power station to be offered as a package.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(363,'Railway PRO','Saarstahl Rail plant in Hayange, EUR 200 million contract with Infrabel for “green” rails','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/saarstahl-rail-plant-in-hayange-eur-200-million-contract-with-infrabel-for-green-rails/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Saarstahl-326x245.jpg','May 24, 2023','2023-09-20 17:06:13','Already a frontrunner on the French rail market, the Saarstahl Rail plant in Hayange has signed a EUR 200 million contract with Belgian infrastructure manager Infrabel.\nThe agreement covers the delivery of 2,800 km of “green” track over four years. Last year, 262,000 tonnes of rail were rolled at Hayange, 87% of which came from scrap.\nThe Hayange plant, part of the SHS – Stahl Holding – Saar GmbH & Co group, won the public tender launched by Infrabel at the end of last year thanks to a “more competitive” offer than its competitors. Although the tender did not include environmental criteria in its specifications, the fact that it produces rails using low-carbon processes weighed in favour of the German-owned French plant.\n“The Saarstahl example shows that the market is moving towards innovative, more sustainable and competitive solutions. Infrabel is closely following developments and will from now on integrate them into its procurement policy, with the intention of stimulating innovation and contributing to an increasingly sustainable rail sector,” said Benoît Gilson, Infrabel’s CEO.\nEnvironmentally friendly production technology\nSince their purchase in 2021 by the German group, the Saarstahl Rail plant in Hayange and the Ascoval plant in Saint-Saulve (northern France) have been working in concert to produce “green” rail tracks, the spearhead of the company’s decarbonisation. So far, 87% of the rails (227,000 tonnes last year) have been produced from recycled scrap, melted with an electric arc at Saint Saulve. They are then rolled at Hayange and shipped to customers. According to Saarstahl, this process reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 70%, or 425,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\nA first delivery of 900 tonnes of railway rails has been made to Infrabel’s Belgian workshops in Schaerbeek.

PLN 65 million (EUR 14.4 million) will be the co-financing of the contract under Poland’s recovery and resilience plan.\nThe new hybrid trains will enter passenger services in the second half of 2024. According to the contract, Newag will deliver the first two vehicles within 16 months of signing the contract, and the remaining multiple units, in 17 months.\nThe agreement was signed on May 15, 2023, by the Marshal of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Mieczysław Struk and the Deputy Marshal, Leszek Bonna, and the president of Newag, Zbigniew Konieczek.\n“It will be much more comfortable, more efficient, but also more beneficial for the environment, because the dual drive means fuel savings and reduction of pollutant emissions,” Mieczysław Struk said.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe electro-diesel Impuls 2 trains will be equipped with air conditioning and will be adapted to the needs of people with disabilities.The safety of the journey will be ensured by a monitoring system. The hybrid trains will provide passengers with free Wi-Fi and on board travel information through a modern dynamic passenger information system. The authorities say that although the contract does not stipulate, the trains will be designed to allow the possibility to install super-capacitors in the future. This will allow trains to use the energy generated during braking when starting from a stop.\nThe new hybrid trains are intended to be deployed on rail connections from Gdańsk towards Kartuzy, 37 km west from region’s capital and to Kościerzyna, 60 km south-west of Gdańsk as well as on other lines.\nAt the end of March, Pomorskie Voivodship ordered from Newag 29 Impuls EMUs part of a framework agreement signed in 2022 for two trains. EUR 235.6 million is the total value of the 31 new trains, EUR 147.8 million of which being the European co-financing.\nThe new electro-diesel Impuls 2 are also expected to operate the 20 km PKM Line (Pomeranian Metropolitan Railway) in Tri-City area, connecting Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport with Wrzeszcz. The authorities will soon complete the electrification of the line which was commissioned in September 2015, consisting of railway lines 248 and 253, and is currently used by 400,000 passengers a month. Recently, testing has been launched for a section of PKM with four electric trains expected to enter operation in June. In the first year of operation (in 2016), PKM Line carried 2 million passengers followed by an increase of 1 additional million passengers in 2017 and in 2018 the ridership reached more than 4 million passengers. In the six years of operation (until 2021), the line has been used by more than 17.5 million passengers.\nPart of the PKM project, the operators Polregio and PKP SKM operate four routes with one in Gdańsk agglomeration (the Gdańsk Wrzeszcz – Gdańsk Osowa – Gdynia Główna route) and three regional connections (Gdańsk– Kartuzy; Kościerzyna – Gdańsk – Gdynia and Kościerzyna – Gdańsk Wrzeszcz – Gdynia). The line offers residents of Kartuzy a less than one hour journey to Gdańsk central station and also provides access to other served cities within 30 minutes.\nThe Pomorska Kolej Metropolitalna company is implementing improvements, including a rail bypass and electrification of the line. In addition, the plans also include the construction of a new branch (PKM Południe – the second phase of the project’s development) which will provide connectivity between the city center of Gdańsk and its southern districts and neighboring communes.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe project covers the construction of a new 7.5 km railway line with 6 stops from the SKM Gdańsk Śródmieście stop through the southern districts of Gdańsk to Kowal where a transport hub will be constructed providing connections to the existing transport modes as well as a three-level car park for 2,100 cars. The project also provides for the possibility of a later connection of the agglomeration section of PKM Południe with both the existing railway line No. 248 (PKM) and the currently closed line No. 229 Pruszcz Gdański – Stara Piła, owned by PKP PLK, which requires modernisation.\nWhen the project is completed, the line will provide a 14-minute travel from Kowal to Gdańsk Główny, three times less than on road transport.\nIn March, PKM Południe project reached a milestone when the southern districts agreed on the implementation of the project which would take place until 2029 with the support of European co-financing. The authorities plan to submit next year the necessary documentation to obtain European funds. The project will be also financed by the City of Gdańsk with a PLN 28 million (EUR 6.24 million) budget for 2023-2026. With these funds, the documentation work is expected to take 3-4 years and the construction, another 2-3 years.

Given that over 50% of rail freight volumes cross at least one national border, it is critical that this is carried out in a coordinated manner between infrastructure managers across all corridors,” ERFA says.\nRegarding coordination, the discussion must shift from solely a discussion on coordination of works to an agreement on coordination of alternative capacity. Infrastructure managers must implement a system whereby as much alternative international capacity is made available as possible in the event of capacity restrictions. This alternative capacity should take into consideration the parameter needs of EU rail freight transport as much as possible.\n“Modal shift is not solely the responsibility of rail freight companies, but also policy makers and infrastructure managers. Rail freight companies cannot achieve modal shift alone in the next years in the context of extensive infrastructure constraints on core networks and increasing customer expectations on the performance of rail freight,” ERFA President, Dirk Stahl, said.\nIn order to maximise the possibilities for rerouting, infrastructure managers must assess the possibility of using capacity in neighboring member states. The European Commission should explore allowing for derogations in European legislation (Train Drivers Directive, Railway Vehicle Authorisation) to allow for rail freight to utilize infrastructure in neighbouring member states in the event of international rerouting subject to it being deemed safe to do so by the relevant national safety authorities and the driver having sufficient route knowledge.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(366,'Railway PRO','Big 5 Construct Egypt returns bigger than ever to shore up sustainable growth in USD 68.5 billion market','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/big-5-construct-egypt-returns-bigger-than-ever-to-shore-up-sustainable-growth-in-usd-68-5-billion-market/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Egypt-326x245.png','May 24, 2023','2023-09-20 17:06:27','The 5th edition of Big 5 Construct Egypt 2023 to bring the inaugural editions of Egypt Infrastructure & Water Expo and Big 5 Egypt Security, Fire & Smart Buildings Summit \nFor the first time, the events will be co-located with the Middle East Coatings Show, bringing together the full ecosystem of paints & coatings industry \nEndorsed by the Ministry of Housing, Utilities, and Urban Communities, Big 5 Construct Egypt will boast the largest presence of international suppliers \n\n \nCairo, Egypt, May 2023: Under the patronage of Egypt’s Prime Minister, H.

The share of rail has remained constant over the period 2018-2021, with minimal growth forecast.\nDue to the capacity of the currently used railway and the non-completion of the Brenner Base Tunnel, the analysis does not expect significant changes in the shares of the two modes in the foreseeable future. Thus, by 2030 an increase of rail to 36% is achievable and this share will not expand before 2040.\nThe situation is completely different in Alpine transit in Switzerland. In 2021, about 75.45% of freight was transported by rail. According to the forecast, the share is expected to rise to 83.7% in 2030. Every day, 260 rail freight routes across the Alps are available in Switzerland.\nEvery third tonne by rail across the Austrian Alps\nAlpine connections in both countries play an important role in freight transport. iMonitraf data! data show that in 2021, 165.9 million tonnes of freight crossed the Alps: 66% (109.5 million tonnes) by road and 34% (56.4 million tonnes) by rail.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(368,'Railway PRO','Network Rail completes Severn and Carno viaduct refurbishment','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/network-rail-completes-severn-and-carno-viaduct-refurbishment/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Severn-and-Carno-viaduct-from-river-PR-326x245.png','May 23, 2023','2023-09-20 17:06:37','Network Rail has completed the major refurbishment of Severn and Carno viaduct near Caersws, Powys, as well as a large section of track work near Newtown along the Cambrian line.\nWith the viaduct now looking better that is has in decades, local communities and tourists can fully enjoy a normal working train service in the area of surrounding natural beauty in the summer period.\nFirst constructed in 1860, the 70-metre-long viaduct has been reconstructed twice in 1906 and 1927 and carried the railway over where the rivers Carno and Severn meet.\nBy jacking up the railway on top of the viaduct and working from floating platforms, or pontoons, on the river, teams of engineers from Network Rail and contractors AmcoGiffen have replaced three of a total of eleven spans of timber beams.

A total of 17 tonnes of timber has been donated to local farmers and residents. The local school has already made plans to use the timber to construct outside benches for their pupils.\nAdditional teams removed and replaced 2 kilometres of track further east in Newtown to increase the reliability of journeys for passengers. Extra resilience work was also carried out on railway points, which allow trains to move from one track to another, along with drainage installation.\nNetwork rail will also realise overnight track renewal work on the Cambrian line until the first week of July.\n“This work by Network Rail will help make the railway infrastructure on the Cambrian line more resilient and improve the reliability of our passenger services.

This is how the future of our cities is made,” the mayor of Gaia commented.\n“It is not possible achieve carbon neutrality in 2030 if we are not able to find a replacement for individual transport. The two municipalities are capable of working together, resulting in benefits for the populations of both the counties,” the mayor of Porto said.\nIn 2020, Porto Metro announced the winner of a EUR 288 million contract for the construction of the 3 km Yellow Line with three stations and the 2.7 km Pink Line which is a circular metro line connecting São Bento and Casa da Música. The project covers the construction of 6.2 km of metro lines with seven stations.

The measure, which got the green light from the European Commission and the French Council of State, is the subject of a decree published on Tuesday in the Official Journal in Paris.\n“Scheduled public passenger air transport services prohibited by Chapter II of Article L.6412-3 of the Transport Code are those for which a substitutable rail link provides, in each direction, a route of less than two and a half hours,” the text of the act states.\nShort flights in France banned from 2021, but the measure has been challenged\nThis ban, which is provided for in the Climate and Resilience Act of 22 August 2021 and is already in force in France, was suspended pending an in-depth investigation by the European Commission, following a complaint from part of the airline industry, which considered it contrary to the principles of competition and unsuited to the fight against climate change. The ban does not cover connecting flights.\nIn December 2022, the European Commission approved France’s plan to ban short-haul air flights with rail alternatives, but only three routes will be affected. The original proposal, which required a green light from Brussels, was to affect eight routes.\nThe commission said the ban could only be put in place if there were real rail alternatives available for the same route – i.e. more direct connections each way every day.

Wabtec is currently in the design phase and is planning the first delivery in 2024.\n“The tailored approach is designed to install the latest technologies where necessary to provide the greatest benefit to MTR’s fleet. This project provides an innovative and lasting transport solution unlocking the potential of one of our strategic customers assets,” said Garry Mowbray, Group Managing Director and Regional Vice President of Wabtec UK.\nFollowing a detailed feasibility study of modernising these locomotives, the project focuses on three key areas. Wabtec will upgrade the locomotives existing control electronics and the motor alternator control units, as well as replace the battery charger units. The control electronics upgrade also will include a datalogger, which provides comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, Wabtec will design and build new automatic test equipment to ensure the newly refurbished electronic racks meet different modes of operation.\nMTR’s modernisations come as the company looks to meet the growing demands on its transit network by maximising and extending the capabilities of the entire locomotive fleet. The project strives to extend the service life of the locomotives by more than 15 years.\n“With Wabtec’s extensive knowledge of this particular locomotive, I am confident that the project will be delivered on time and enhance the operational efficiency and performance of MTR locomotives,” said Kim-Hung Lee, Acting Chief of Operations Engineering Maintenance at MTR Corporation.\nThe Mk3 battery-electric locomotives have been built by Wabtec for MTR in 1996 and 1997.\nThe teams from Wabtec’s United Kingdom and Hong Kong offices are leading the project in collaboration with MTR Corporation.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(373,'Railway PRO','TX Logistik orders 115 new wagons','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/tx-logistik-orders-115-new-wagons/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TX-Logistik-T3000-wagons-326x245.jpeg','May 23, 2023','2023-09-20 17:07:08','TX Logistik announced it will acquire further 115 double pocket wagons of the type T3000 produced by the Slovakian manufacturer Tatravagonka. The delivery of the first wagons is scheduled for late summer this year and will be used for company’s intermodal transport services.\nThe new wagons have a 30-foot container suspension, fast-acting brakes and thermostable wheelsets of the latest generation.\nThe T3000 is increasingly becoming the standard wagon in intermodal transport, according to TX Logistik, with which both semi-trailers and containers can be flexibly transported at a maximum speed of up to 120 km per hour. In addition, the model is particularly well adapted to the TX transhipment system NiKRASA, with which non-craneable semi-trailers can also be easily loaded onto the rail.\nThe recently introduced new version 3.0 does not need a terminal ramp any more, is stackable and has been optimised once again for the rail transport of megatrailers.\nWith the new order for T3000 double pocket wagons, TX Logistik is fulfilling its strategic goal of increasing its own share of freight wagons for intermodal transport to 50 percent overall. On this segment, the continuing market demand for transport by rail, driven not least by the political goal of expanding the share of rail freight to 25 percent by 2030, has led to a shortage of rolling stock. With access to its own wagon capacities, TX Logistik AG will thus be able to react even more flexibly to intermodal demand in its European network in the future.\nRolling stock investment is part of TX Logistik AG strategy to meet traffic demand. In May, the company, together with FS Italiane Group, has signed a contract with Siemens Mobility for the procurement of 40 Vectron locomotives including the provision of full-service maintenance services for a period of 15 years with an option for two additional years.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(374,'Railway PRO','Design contract for another line of Madrid commuter network','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/design-contract-awarded-for-another-line-of-madrid-commuter-network/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Adif-trains-Pinar_LasMatas-rail-line-326x245.jpg','May 22, 2023','2023-09-20 17:07:13','Adif has launched the renewal programme of the 38.5 km conventional line that connects the Chamartín-Clara Campoamor and Príncipe Pío stations, which fundamentally provides service to Madrid Cercanías through lines C-3a, C7, C-8 and C-10.\nAdif awarded Intecsa-Inersa a EUR 1.65 million contract to elaborate the design for the modernisation of Chamartín – Príncipe Pío suburban railway line as a previous step for the bidding of construction works that will reinforce the reliability and capacity on the stretch. The works which form part of the Madrid Cercanías plan will be developed while maintaining the provision of the railway service.\nThe work covers the replacement of all track elements including the ballast, rails and switches, as well as actions for electrification and catenary system, passages, slopes and embankments.

By mid-2024, 40 km of mainline will be under construction in Estonia.\nIn addition, Rail Baltica Estonia awarded Ardanuy Ingeneria a contract to design the stations located in in Harju and Pärnu counties.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(378,'Railway PRO','Network Rail to invest EUR 50 billion under CP7','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/network-rail-to-invest-eur-50-billion-under-cp7/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Network-Rail-1-326x245.jpg','May 22, 2023','2023-09-20 17:07:30','Network Rail has announced a GBP 44.1 billion (EUR 50.7 billion) investment under the five-year plan (Control Period 7 – CP7) for the railway in England and Wales. The investment to be implemented from 2024 until 2029 will tackle climate change and will improve train performance from current levels, both for passenger and freight traffic.\nIn December the Department for Transport (DfT) published two key documents. One set out what it wanted Britain railway to deliver (High Level Output Statement – HLOS) and the other, how much funding it was making available (Statement of Funds Available – SoFA).\nOver the last two years, and more intensively over the past three months, Network Rail has been working on plans to deliver the best railway it can for the amount of money available – GBP 44.1 billion, which, after adjusting for changes in electricity costs, is GBP 1.8 billion (EUR 2 billion) more than CP6 (2019-2024).\nWhilst funding for enhancements to British railway is no longer included in this funding settlement, the Government has already committed substantial investment – some GBP 96 billion (EUR 110.4 billion) – in the Integrated Rail Plan, with a substantial portion of these funds being delivered in projects during the course of CP7.\nThe investment includes regional plans for railway in England and Wales and plans for Britain’s national functions. Scotland’s Railway continues to align CP7 plans with Scottish Ministers’ HLOS and SoFA, which was published in early February 2023. The final Scotland CP7 SBP is expected to be published in summer 2023.\nFor the two regions (England and Wales), CP7 considers three main pillars including the focusing on customers, supporting all rail users, as well as the economic growth and connectivity.\n“Our plan for CP7 is ambitious, focussed on our passengers and customers and reflects the current complexities and challenges facing the industry. There will no doubt be obstacles ahead and I look forward to working collaboratively with the sector to deliver this plan, reshape the industry and build a railway that is fit for the future,” Network Rail’s chief executive Andrew Haines said.\nNetwork Rail’s CP7 starts from April 2024 and runs until 2029. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will now review this initial strategic business plan and review how it measures up against the Government’s HLOS and SoFA and publish its draft determination on this plan later this year including targets, measures and incentives it will hold Network Rail to deliver over CP7.\n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(379,'Railway PRO','Agreement to improve Western Balkans transport connections','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/agreement-signed-to-improve-western-balkans-transport-connections/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EU-Western-Balkans-transport-326x245.jpg','May 19, 2023','2023-09-20 17:07:35','The European Commission signed high-level agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia to adapt Western Balkans rail network, the roads, ports and inland waterways, to the TEN-T transport network to meet EU’s standards for effectively connecting the towns and cities between the two regions.\nThe agreement was signed on the margins of the Connectivity Summit in Budva, Montenegro on May 16, 2023 and represents a major step towards greater transport connectivity between the European Union and our Western Balkan partners.\n“With the signature of these agreements, and with our proposal for a Western Balkans European Transport Corridor, we are laying the ground to integrate the transport network of the Western Balkans into the EU’s. It will promote the development of sustainable and resource-efficient transport connectivity between the EU and these countries. The importance of closer and seamless transport connections cannot be underestimated,” Commissioner for Transport Adina Vălean said.\nThe Transport Community, which brings together the EU Member States represented by the Commission and the Western Balkan partners, actively supports the execution of projects connecting the six countries with each other, and with the EU.\nThe integration of the Western Balkan transport networks into the TEN-T will also help prepare EU candidate countries and potential candidates for their future accession to the EU.\n“Connectivity Summit focuses on investments in transport infrastructure and reforms of policies that will facilitate transition to more efficient mobility in the Western Balkans in line with the strategic documents of the Transport Community. Actions targeting the main road and rail border crossings on the indicative extension of the TEN-T network in the Western Balkans, including with the neighbouring EU Member States, will address inefficiencies and delays at those points and modernise the operations,” Transport Community Permanent Secretariat Director Matej Zakonjsek said.\nThe Western Balkans rail network has a total length of almost 6,500 km on both core (more than 2,600 km) and comprehensive (3,895 km) TEN-T networks consisting of the three corridors (Vc, VIII and X) and seven routes.\n“An important step for integrating the transport network of the Western Balkans with that of the EU, which should help bring better rail, road and waterborne and multimodal connections for businesses and citizenz across our regions. Promoting smooth border crossings is also key by removing unnecessary checks ands rad tape, and ensuring sufficient infrastructure capacity,” EU Transport Director Mona Bjorklund said.\nThe summit brought together professionals and political stakeholders from the region and the EU to discuss issues related to sustainable and efficient trade, and transport and logistics as prerequisites for attracting investment and boosting economic growth within the region. It also addressed strengthening relations between the region and EU and was co-organised by the Transport Community Treaty and CEFTA Secretariats.\nIn 2021, the states of the Western Balkans signed a joint declaration recognising the importance of rail transport as well as the need to improve the rail links at the regional level and the cross-border connections with the EU’s member states.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(380,'Railway PRO','Taiwan awards high-speed train contract','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/taiwan-awards-high-speed-train-contract/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hitachi-Toshiba-Taiwan-326x245.jpg','May 19, 2023','2023-09-20 17:07:42','The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC) awarded the Hitachi Toshiba Supreme Consortium (HTSC) a contract for the supply of 12 new generation of high-speed trains (144 cars) based on the N700S train platform.\nThe consortium comprises Hitachi, Toshiba Corporation and Toshiba Infrastructure Systems and Solutions Corporation. JPY 124 billion (USD 901.6 million) is the value of the contract with the delivery scheduled to begin in 2026.\nThe Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation started operation of high-speed trains in 2007 between Taipei and Kaohsiung, introducing the Japanese Shinkansen system. The new trains will enhance the capacity of passenger services.\nThe 300 – metre – long train will be put into operation at a maximum speed of 300 km/h. The new high – speed train based on the N700S train platform will be lighter and have better aerodynamic performance compared with the existing 700T. It will be energy efficient by adopting the compact traction system, combining a silicon carbide (SiC) device with a blower-less cooling system. The new train will be equipped with lithium-ion batteries (SCiB) to power the train at low speed in case of power outage.\nIn Taiwan, many people are already using the reliable high – speed railway, which has provided unparalleled safety and reliability to passengers for more than a decade. It is anticipated that introducing the new rolling stock will encourage even more people to make the modal shift to environmentally friendly high – speed railway.\nThe train procurement was initially planned to be concluded in 2019 to provide additional capacity, as the THSRC anticipated the increase of passenger numbers. The original plan included the purchase of trains with 16 railcars, but the price would be much higher than the price for a Japanese domestic company. The increased price was due to the modifications the consortium should have made to meet the requirements of THSRC. The new Taiwanese rolling stock (the N700S train) will be similar to the one operated by the Central Japan Railway Company.\nIn 2022, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation has transported 54.16 million passengers with a traffic of 9,338 million passenger – kilometers.\n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(381,'Railway PRO','Deutsche Bahn acquires 73 new ICE trains','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/eur-two-billion-investment-deutsche-bahn-buys-73-new-ice-trains/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ICE-train-326x245.jpg','May 19, 2023','2023-09-20 17:07:46','The German company will allocate approximately EUR 2 billion for the purchase of new long-distance trains.

The PMT has already gained recognition nationally and internationally for its accuracy. The results of the modelling carried out with the PMT are of interest to rail infrastructure managers from Western Europe in the context of the prospects for the development of the rail market in Poland and the CEE.\nCPK’s rail investments involve constructing almost 2,000 km of railway lines, divided into 10 spokes. These new railway lines will primarily serve long-distance trains, including the high-speed railway that will initially reach speeds of 250 km/h, with the possibility of increasing this to 350 km/h in the future. Regional trains and freight trains will also use the new lines on selected routes. Key sections, such as Warsaw – CPK – Łódź, are set to be available as early as 2027, in parallel with the completion of the CPK airport. The new railway infrastructure is due to provide high accessibility to Poland’s capital and the CPK transport hub, with estimates indicating that up to 40% of the people using it will commute by rail.\n \nAn advanced planning tool for developing efficient transport systems\nThe Passenger Transport Model (PMT) is an advanced planning tool that provides the best scenarios for creating an efficient transport system, including cross-border connections, allowing the development of forecasts for the entire country, covering road, rail and air transport. The PMT is capable of estimating the impact of strategic transport investments, such as the construction of high-speed rail, as well as the development of local or regional rail connections. Since its development in December 2020, the PMT has undergone four updates and has been made available to almost 50 entities worldwide. The PMT forecasts have already been used in the development of around 150 studies and projects.\nThe latest version of the PMT, which is the result of an update related to the plans for the expansion of the railway network and the modernisation of lines under the PKP PLK “Kolej Plus” programme, considers the status of the existing and planned railway network, such as line electrification, number of tracks and permissible speeds, while providing optimistic forecasts for the newly planned and modernised railway lines. The analysis of the data for individual lines shows a moderate growth trend for the railway lines not covered by investments and optimistic forecast results for the newly planned and modernised railway lines, which is due to the increased attractiveness and competitiveness of railway transport compared to other modes of transport.\n“Recent years have been full of changes that fundamentally impacted the forecasts for railway traffic. First, the pandemic overturned thinking about transport, and when the situation returned to normal, a war began. Our forecasts, therefore, require changes regarding the determination of passenger flows, cargo types and even the number of inhabitants in the individual countries in our region of Europe. Updates are necessary and allow us to plan subsequent projects so that they are optimal, economically viable and meet future passenger needs,” Michał Pyzik, Transport Modelling & Traffic Forecasting Coordinator at CPK said.\nThe PMT’s latest forecasts are optimistic about the impact of the significant financial investments planned for railway modernisation in Poland over the next few years. In contrast to the PMT’s projections from a year ago, which estimated that Polish long-distance rail operators would transport a total of 120 million passengers annually in 2050, the latest forecast indicates a 12% increase, with an estimated 134 million passengers being transported in the same year. These promising figures signal a bright future for the railway industry in Poland and suggest that the planned modernisation efforts will help drive growth in the sector.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nCPK presents benefits of forecasting in developing sustainable transport infrastructure\nRailway infrastructure is critical for enabling mobility, and as transport demands continue to grow then modernising and expanding the railway network becomes essential. The European Investment Bank (EIB) emphasises the importance of filling the gaps in the CEE transport system for the development of the region, bringing significant economic benefits and at the same time enhancing the security of the continent. Moreover, to meet global environmental policy objectives, it is imperative to develop sustainable transport systems that reduce emissions. In this regard, large-scale transport infrastructure development projects must incorporate network traffic forecasting as a fundamental element. By doing so, transport connections can be designed to not only be profitable and efficient in the future but also to stimulate economic growth and provide long-term benefits to the regions they serve.\nTo forecast traffic and plan accordingly, Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK) is using its own tool, the Passenger Transport Model (PMT), developed in-house by CPK experts. This tool helps in the process of planning and implementing one of the largest transport infrastructure development programs in the region. The PMT has already gained recognition nationally and internationally for its accuracy. The results of the modelling carried out with the PMT are of interest to rail infrastructure managers from Western Europe in the context of the prospects for the development of the rail market in Poland and the CEE.\nCPK’s rail investments involve constructing almost 2,000 km of railway lines, divided into 10 spokes. These new railway lines will primarily serve long-distance trains, including the high-speed railway that will initially reach speeds of 250 km/h, with the possibility of increasing this to 350 km/h in the future. Regional trains and freight trains will also use the new lines on selected routes. Key sections, such as Warsaw – CPK – Łódź, are set to be available as early as 2027, in parallel with the completion of the CPK airport. The new railway infrastructure is due to provide high accessibility to Poland’s capital and the CPK transport hub, with estimates indicating that up to 40% of the people using it will commute by rail.\n \nInternational traffic forecasts\nRail passenger traffic in international passenger transport in CEE significantly affects the overall traffic forecast. Therefore, in order to make it complete and reliable, CPK is cooperating with entities from selected neighbouring countries in this regard. The PMT estimates a growth in international traffic by considering new connections within the HSR V4 project with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. In the future, the model will also include data related to cooperation with RB Rail AS, which is implementing the Rail Baltica project to connect Kaunas, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki and Warsaw. Based on the cooperation agreement signed with Ukrainian Railways in January 2023, CPK will provide PMT to Ukraine to extend the model into this region.\nThe results of modelling and forecasting using PMT are often used as the basis for applying for EU funding. The increased attractiveness of railways and rising passenger numbers align with the European Union’s priorities to protect the environment and promote low-carbon transport. As the global impact of infrastructure becomes increasingly important, the latest version of the PMT network has also been adapted to be compatible with the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS).\nSeveral changes to the railways should ensure that this environmentally friendly mode of transport continues to gain supporters. A critical condition for this success is the further development of what transport offers, supported by the liberalization of the railway sector in Poland. The emergence of market competition should contribute to a significant increase in supply and a reduction in ticket prices, resulting in a dynamic increase in rail transport popularity, as seen in other European countries.\nImplementing this objective further demonstrates that CPK is not just an airport. As a new transport system, the Polish government aims to create a transfer hub between Warsaw and Łódź, where air, rail and road transport can be integrated.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(386,'Railway PRO','Kyriakos Mitsotakis sued by families of Greek train crash victims','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/kyriakos-mitsotakis-sued-by-families-of-greek-train-crash-victims/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Greece-326x245.jpg','May 17, 2023','2023-09-20 17:08:37','The families of the victims of the train crash in Greece that killed 57 people on 28 February 2023 have filed a lawsuit against Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the victims’ representative announced.\n“It is an important day today, more important than Sunday’s elections.

However, since the document was drawn up, the price of materials and the cost of labour have increased and the deterioration has continued, so the figure put forward four years ago is no longer relevant.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(388,'Railway PRO','First tracks laid on Yanchep rail extension project','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/first-tracks-laid-on-yanchep-rail-extension-project/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Yanchep-rail-extension-project-326x245.jpg','May 17, 2023','2023-09-20 17:08:44','The first 2.7 km of the 14.5 km Yanchep rail extension project has been laid within the Ningana Bushland area, which is located between the future Eglinton and Yanchep stations.\nStructural steel framework is well underway across the three new stations of Alkimos, Eglinton and Yanchep, and four escalators were recently installed at Alkimos which will connect the platform and concourse levels.

Under our plans, we intend to modernise and develop the rail infrastructure and to modernise the rolling stock, including the procurement of new vehicles,” Rabie Majidi, Tunisia’s Minister of Transport said at the Middle East Rail, held in Abu Dhabi on 15 – 16 May.\nTunisia intends to implement 47 infrastructure projects until 2030, with investments expected to reach 63 billion Tunisian dinars (USD 20 billion). Rail transport in Tunisia will be a strategic sector and the investment value is estimated at 36 billion Tunisian dinars (USD 11.7 billion).\nCountry’s 2,200 km railway network is owned and operated by Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT) including the regional and suburban rail lines. In March, the Minister of Transport inaugurated the first new electric rail line (Line E) in Tunis metropolitan area known as Tunis Rapid Rail Network (RFR). The 6 km rail line provides transport services in the capital’s south-western districts and will initially link the centre of Tunis to Sidi Hassine Séjoumi, from Barcelone station to Bougatfa station. The project included the construction of a 280-metre long tunnel (Tunnel de Saida Manoubia), a maintenance facility at Sidi Fathallah and a power supply station at Gobaa.\nLine E would be extended to 18.4 km with 13 stations connecting Tunis, Ezzouhour, Zahrouni and Séjoumi. The new suburban railway line has been supported by the World Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), German banking institution KFW and the French Development Agency (AFD). From 2007 to 2023, SYSTRA led the project management consortium with Studi, under the supervision of the SNCFT.  A consortium of Colas Rail, Siemens and Tunisian company Somatra-Get was awarded a EUR 145 million contract to construct two lines in Tunis – the Line E and Line D – totalling 20 km. Colas Rail delivered track, catenary networks, power supply, remote surveillance and data collecting system, depot equipment and system integration, while Siemens has equipped the line with ETCS L1 and installed centralised control station equipment. In 2018 SNCFT and Hyundai Rotem signed a 416 million Tunisian dinars (USD 135.6 million, in current prices) contract for the supply of 28 four-car trains. On the new line, each train runs at a speed of 35 km/h at 7-minute intervals and has a capacity of 2,408 passengers per train.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe authorities plan to develop the entire rail infrastructure in the Tunis area and to provide other cities rail connections to the capital. “We want to build a network with five lines with a length of more than 70 km designed to provide connections from north to south and from east to west. We are working to start studies for the connections with the northern districts of the capital. Besides these new rail links, we also plan to expand the rail network to the neighboring countries to ensure rapid rail freight transport services and increased connection in the region,” Rabie Majidi explained.\nDuring the conference in Abu Dhabi, Tunisia’s Minister of transport and the Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Rail, Shadi Malak, discussed on the possibilities to for transport development and rail expansion in the Middle East and North Africa region and to explore new opportunities. The representative of Etihad Rail has expressed that the UAE is ready to strengthen cooperation and partnership with Tunisia and in the field of rail transport.\nTo implement the projects, the Tunisian authorities are looking for investors as not all projects can be state funded. “The strategic vision for railways also covers restructuring plans and identification of the best options to realise the projects including through public-private partnerships. In this matter, we will develop the legislation according to international standards,” the Minister of Transport said.\nIn December 2021, the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced a EUR 45 million financing for the public transport authority Transtu to acquire new trains and equipment for the 19 km Tunis – Goulette – Marsa (TGM) light rail line.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(390,'Railway PRO','Contract for 100 Siemens locomotives under question','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/contract-for-100-siemens-locomotives-under-question/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vectron-MS.jpg-326x245.jpeg','May 17, 2023','2023-09-20 17:08:56','A surprising announcement was made at the weekend by János Lázár, the Minister of Construction and Transport, that the Hungarian government will “end the friendship”, as he put it, with Siemens, one of Germany’s biggest companies, reports the country’s press. Contract for 100 Siemens locomotives under question.\n\nThe background to the dispute is that at Hungary’s Paks nuclear power plant, the control system is provided by a German-French consortium, but as it is currently a dual-use technology from a legal point of view, the current European regulatory environment requires the relevant national export authority to authorise its civilian use. This has already been done in the case of France, but not in the case of Germany, where Siemens is the company in charge, reports hungarytoday.hu.\nThe government is no longer counting on Siemens’ involvement in the renewal of the railway fleet, the minister said, as quoted by Atv.hu. According to the report, János Lázár said that “we are no longer friends with them”, adding that there are no plans in the future to buy Siemens vehicles.\nSiemens locomotives under question\nThe announcement is significant for several reasons. First, former Minister of Innovation and Technology László Palkovics reported last spring that a public procurement procedure for 115 new electric locomotives had been concluded, with Siemens Mobility Kft. winning the tender. and Siemens Mobility Austria GmbH. The plan was to use Siemens Vectron locomotives to renew and expand the InterCity service in Hungary, with a framework agreement signed in April 2022 and delivery contracts expected to be signed by the end of 2022. If the schedule had been adhered to, the first locomotives in the procurement would have entered service in 2024, but now it looks like none of the project will be realised, Világgazdaság points out.\nIn addition, the minister said they will review cooperation with Siemens in the future.\nBut perhaps what best explains the current situation and the hostile relationship between the two sides is the issue of the expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant. As has already been mentioned, a national export licence is needed for the control system to be supplied by the German-French consortium, because legally it is now a dual-use technology.\nHowever, the German government continues to block Siemens Energy from delivering the control system for the new reactor units at the Paks II nuclear power plant in Hungary.\nThe German company’s consortium partner, the French company Framatome, has already received approval. In any case, Germany is currently pursuing a strongly anti-nuclear stance in its so-called green transition, having recently shut down its last nuclear power plants, while Hungary has the complete opposite stance on the matter.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(391,'Railway PRO','Romania-Poland joint declaration in support of the Rail2Sea corridor','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/romania-poland-rail2sea-corridor/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sorin-Grindeanu-Andrzej-Adamczyk-326x245.jpg','May 16, 2023','2023-09-20 17:09:01','Romania and Poland, through the Ministers of Transport of the two countries, Sorin Grindeanu and Andrzej Adamczyk respectively, signed on Tuesday in Bucharest a joint declaration in support of the Rail2Sea corridor.\n“Our intention is to maximise the opportunities opened up by these projects, so as to strengthen the importance of Central, North-East and South-East European countries,” Grindeanu said.\nThe declaration is also to be signed by other European countries transited by these corridors: Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia. “The CEF financing of the Rail2Sea (rail) and Via Carpatia (road) projects will increase the importance of our Region in European and international transport.

These grants will help bring riders faster, safer, more reliable service on America’s rails,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.\nThe selected projects are: \nThe Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has received the largest financing worth USD 200 million to acquire up to 300 electric passenger railcars to replace railcars that have been operating since the 1980s. the provided funding “will allow CTA to replace its oldest, most outdated railcars with more modern, safe, and reliable cars, ensuring riders can get to where they’re going on-time and with ease,” Senator Durbin and Representative Quigley said when announced the funding.\nThe FTA funding allows the agency to begin planning and designing for the future procurement of its next generation of railcars – the 9000-Series. In 2021, CTA has introduces the first 7000-series trains operating the Blue Line, second most heavily traveled rail line in the system, operating between Forest Park and O’Hare International Airport. These new trains are manufactured by CRRC Sifang America under a USD 1.6 billion contract signed in 2016 for the supply of 400 cars. CTA’s rolling stock comprises 1,500 railcars of three different models purchase between 1981 and 2015. The age of railcars impacts their performance, which is why public transit railcars like those used on the CTA have a useful life expectancy of 31 years, with routine maintenance. The procurement of new railcar will improve agency’s state of good repair needs in aging passenger rolling stock which is nearly 40 years.\nRanked second in terms of funding value, the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan District obtained USD 196.3 million for the procurement of 48 LRVs to replace the existing vehicles that have exceeded or are near the end of their useful life. The 30-year-old MetroLink cars are well maintained and have already exceeded their projected useful lives of 25 years in service. Out of the 31 original MetroLink light rail vehicles, 25 of them are still in service and will continue to be for the next few years until they are replaced by the new light rail vehicles. In the next 4-5 years, the existing fleet is expected to travel 1.8 million miles and it should be replaced. The new vehicles will run on the MetroLink system serving the St. Louis metropolitan region.\nThe Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) is placed third (also in terms of funding value) and will receive USD 130 million to purchase 60 new light rail and heavy rail vehicles. This grant will be completed by a USD 213 million financing that GCRTA secured from the Rail Car Replacement Programme that has a projected price tag of USD 393 million. The new vehicles will save the GCRTA USD 7 million per year by reducing repair costs and provide more comfortable and reliable service for passengers. The authority will acquire high floor light rail vehicles with doors that allow access from existing heavy rail platforms and street level light rail platforms. Thus, enabling the rail cars to operate across the authority’s entire rail network eliminating the need to run two separate fleets. The new rolling stock will replace the existing one purchased in 1981 and 1982.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) obtained USD 71.7 million to replace 24 rail vehicles representing 32% of its fleet. The funding will support the procurement of new locomotives and passenger cars to replace older vehicles that have exceeded or are near the end of their useful life. USD 179.2 million is the total value of the project that also requires local funding that the agency will supplement with support from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), unrestrictive reserve funds, and additional federal funds. The authority is operating the Tri-Rail commuter rail system in Miami on the 116 km South Florida Rail Corridor and transport 12,500 passengers each day.\nUnder the Rail Vehicle Replacement Programme, Utah Transit Authority has obtained USD 60 million to purchase 20 LRVs. The new low-floor cars will replace the existing older high-floor TRAX cars operating the 71 km system in Salt Lake Valley.\nThe Sacramento Regional Transit District in Sacramento (SaCRT), in California, will receive USD 45.1 million to acquire 16 additional light rail vehicles, which will replace older vehicles that have exceeded their useful life. The transit authority will acquire the new low-floor light rail vehicles from Siemens Mobility. In 2020, the manufacturer was awarded a USD 100 million contract for the supply of 20 S700 low-floor light rail vehicles including spare parts and tools. With the purchase of the latest vehicles, Sacramento will benefit 44 new LRVs. This investment will improve the agency’s state of good repair needs and improve service and reliability for the region’s 1.7 million residents.\nUnder the competitive grant process, FTA has received proposals with funding requests worth USD 3.5 billion. Vehicle Replacement Programme is part of the State of Good Repair Formula Grants Programme which provides capital assistance for maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation projects for transit systems.\nThe aging passenger rolling stock contributes to service delays and increased costs and lack newer amenities, such as digital signage and audio tools that improve the riding experience. They may also lack accessibility features, such as direct access into the railcar, for people with reduced mobility or anyone pushing a stroller.\n \n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(399,'Railway PRO','UK rail strikes disrupt Eurovision','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/uk-rail-strikes-disrupt-eurovision/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rail-strike-326x245.png','May 12, 2023','2023-09-20 17:09:37','Rail strikes by ASLEF (the train drivers’ union) and RMT (the hauliers’ union) are causing significant disruption to Northern services in the UK.\nPhotograph: Jane Barlow/P\nRail strikes, signifiant impact\nTricia Williams, director of operations at Northern, said: ‘It is disappointing to see the return of industrial action on Network Rail. “While all strikes disrupt someone, in this case they will have a significant impact on people travelling on our network to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool. “Given the context in which the UK is hosting this international event – on behalf of the Ukrainian people – this is particularly unfortunate.”\nA new ASLEF action, known as “no strike action”, will take place for five consecutive days from Monday 15 to Friday 20 May.

The partnership includes civil works for the two high speed and two freight railway tracks, with Webuild leading the execution of work.\nThe contract also covers viaducts, road bridges, and road and rail underpasses to facilitate train speeds of up to 230 km/h.\nAs a result of this agreement, Webuild anticipates more than 4,000 direct and indirect jobs are to be generated in the Saudi market.\nNeom, a special economic zone, is part of Saudi Arabia’s plans to develop a sustainable urban living to be constructed in Tabuk province, in the north-western part of the country, north of the Red Sea. Part of this project will be constructed The Line, a 170 km long linear city that will define the way a sustainable and smart city should look like.\nThe 34 square kilometers vertical city with a capacity of up to 9 million people, will revolutionise the mobility where traditional cars are completely absent and people will have access to all facilities within a five-minute walk, in addition to the high-speed line.\nNeom high-speed rail line is designed to provide a 20-minute end-to-end journey and will be built in the underground and will be managed by the latest control and safety technologies based on wireless communications. The high-speed connections will be used for passenger transport between the two terminals. The line will have a length of 170 km, the same length as the linear city, which will be only 200-metre-wide and developed 500 metres above sea level.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nIn October 2022, Egis, its subsidiary AuditSafe, and Certifer were selected as the Independent Safety Assessor for the transit system of the Neom Industrial City Connector (NICC) which will comprise of several individual lines covering high-speed rail lines, freight rail lines, metro/GMT rail lines, depot rail lines and platform loops. The transport system, located underground of The Line will be controlled and managed by 5G, fibre, satellite, and wireless solutions throughout the communities of urban development.\nAll services in the city will be automated and powered by artificial artificial intelligence. Neom will be powered by 100% clean energy – including the operations of its industries, through renewable solar, wind and green hydrogen-based energy.\nNeom, which means ‘new future’, is developed from scratch designed on futuristic smart and sustainable concepts on a surface of 26,500 square kilometres. It is a USD 500 billion estimated global project which will be financed from the Public Investment and comprises 10 projects (known as ‘regions’) among which The Line, Oxagon, Trojena and Sindalah.\nIn January 2021, Mohammed bin Salman the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia launched the idea of The Line and in July 2022 has announced the designs of The Line city that redefines the concept of urban development and the way people will live, work, and use public services. The city is designed to reduce the infrastructure footprint and create revolutionary efficiencies in city functions.\nThe unveiled designs “for the city’s vertically layered communities will challenge the traditional flat, horizontal cities and create a model for nature preservation and enhanced human livability. The Line will tackle the challenges facing humanity in urban life today and will shine a light on alternative ways to live,” the Crown Prince said when presented the concept of the city.\nThe Neom project is delivered in several phases with Oxagon expected to have its first residents in 2024 and Trojen becoming a place to live, work and holiday in 2026.

The investment is part of the EU’s TEN-T core network.\nFor the Sieradz – Poznań HSR section CPK has selected the recommended route from four different variants based on numerous analyses, considering the technical, economic, social and environmental factors.\nThe length of the high-speed rail section between Poznań and Sieradz is 155 km and including the connecting lines, 220 km is the total length of the line. Most of this section of the CPK railway ‘spoke’ no. 9 is located in the Wielkopolskie Voivodeship (Greater Poland Voivodeship), excepting the area around Sieradz, Błaszki and Wróblewo, which is in the Łódź Voivodeship.\n“The high-speed railway being built by CPK is a civilisational leap for Polish infrastructure. Thanks to the Sieradz – Poznań HSR section, the Wielkopolska region joins the beneficiaries of the CPK railway projects. This line should have been operational today, but unfortunately 12 years ago the preparations for the construction of the “Y” shaped line, a route connecting Warsaw, Łódź, Poznań and Wrocław, were unnecessarily suspended. Today, we are making up for the lost time, which is very good news for passengers,” the Deputy Minister of Funds and Regional Policy, Marcin Horała, Government Plenipotentiary for CPK, said.\nWhen preparing the feasibility study, following public and authorities’ engagement, the experts replaced proposed variant with new one, which is a combination of the socially and environmentally most favoured three different variants.\n“The variant, which we finally chose, is the optimal solution for the section between Poznań and Sieradz and was developed as a result of consultations with residents and local authorities. It involves the least number of conflicts with residential buildings, it interferes the least with areas of natural value and is the most favourable in terms of conflicts with water intakes and monuments,” Radosław Kantak, CPK Board member for railway investments, said.\nThanks to this investment, the train journey between Warsaw and Poznań should take about two hours from currently more than three hours. Once this section has been opened, passengers should be able to reach Kalisz from the capital in around 1 hour 25 minutes, instead of around 3 hours currently.\nTravel times from Poznań are also going to be reduced: to Kalisz in about 35 minutes, from approx. 1.5 hours, and to Łódź in about 1 hour 10 minutes – now approx. 3 hours. Passengers should be able to reach CPK from Poznań in about 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n				\n				default\n				\n		\n\nTrains on this line are able to reach speeds of up to 250 km/h, with the design speed being 350 km/h. This means that it should be possible to increase the parameters of this railway line in the future without having to rebuild the track. According to the schedule, the opening of the Sieradz-Poznań section should take place after the opening of stage I of the CPK airport and the Warsaw – Łódź HSR line.\nAs part of the ‘Y’ line, CPK has already prepared routes for a 140 km HSR section between Warsaw and Łódź and a 200 km route between Łódź and Wrocław. Design is already underway for both of these sections. The Sieradz – Poznań section is the third CPK investor variant for the “Y” line and the fifth in total – the others being the Łętownia-Rzeszów section in the Podkarpacie region and the Katowice – Ostrava section in Śląsk.\nThe planned Warsaw – Łódź – Sieradz – Wrocław/Poznań line is part of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). In 2021, CPK received more than PLN 108 million in grants under the CEF Reflow Connecting Europe Facility to carry out the design of the CPK tunnel in Łódź and feasibility studies for the sections: Warsaw-Łódź, the CPK junction and the Sieradz – Poznań section. As part of the CEF2 call for proposals, CPK is applying for further, many times higher, funding for the development of these projects.\nThe CPK railway programme envisages the construction of 2,000 km new lines and is a response to more than 30 years of almost total downtime in this field. The assumption is that the journey from most of the largest Polish cities to CPK and Warsaw should take a maximum of 2.5 hours.\nCPK is committed to the development of a high-speed rail system beyond Poland for which a MoU has been signed with RB Rail AS and Správa železnic in January. The three parties intend to create an high-speed network in the Three Seas region which is expected to be created by 4,500 km of connections.

She was answering questions from journalists about the construction of a new bridge over the Danube at Giurgiu-Ruse and the modernisation of the Craiova-Calafat railway.\nThe European Commission supports the project for a new bridge across the Danube between Romania and Bulgaria, but is waiting for the political situation in Sofia to stabilise, the Brussels official said.\n“For the Giurgiu-Ruse bridge, this is a project that is also supported by the European Commission. In order to make progress, a company must be built between Romania and Bulgaria to propose the project. There are also these political instabilities in Bulgaria. The Commission is waiting for the situation in Bulgaria to stabilise, to identify interlocutors who can take decisions that they can follow and support, for a longer period, not just a month or two, I think that is the problem. What the European Commission is doing – it is putting permanent pressure on the authorities, more so on Bulgaria, because Romania is open. The bridge is a joint project, Bulgaria-Romania, we are waiting for the project company or the project promoter, but I have not seen the project, I think they have to submit it together. It is in the European transport maps, so they have to submit it”, said Adina Vălean.\nThe Friendship Bridge, built in 1954 with the support of the USSR\nDesigned by V. Andreev and opened on 20 June 1954, the 2.8 km long Giurgiu-Ruse Friendship Bridge is one of the two bridges over the Danube, together with the Calafat-Vidin Bridge, on the Romanian-Bulgarian border. Construction of the bridge took two and a half years and was supported by the USSR at the time.\nThe Friendship Bridge has both a two-lane road bridge and one for rail traffic (single line), as well as sidewalks for pedestrians. For years there has been talk of building a second bridge, parallel to the existing one, but nothing concrete has happened. There have also been discussions about building other bridges across the Danube between Romania and Bulgaria, at Calarasi-Silistra, Turnu Măgurele-Nikopol or Svishtov.\nPoor access infrastructure to the New Europe Bridge\nThe only one to have materialised was the Friendship Bridge at Calafat-Vidin, built by the Bulgarian side with European funds and inaugurated on 14 June 2013 in a ceremony attended by the then European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, the project being financed by ISPA funds.\nHowever, the 95 km stretch between Golenți (where the newly built railway connecting to the bridge ends) and Craiova is extremely difficult for trains. On a 57 km section of this line (Golenți-Segarcea), train speeds are limited to 30 km/hour due to the extremely poor state of the infrastructure. On the remaining 38 km (Segarcea-Craiova), the maximum speed is 70 km/h.\nAdina Vălean not too optimistic\nEuropean Commissioner Adina Vălean now says that the Romanian authorities have submitted the project for upgrading the Craiova-Golenți section to Brussels and that it is in the process of being evaluated.\nThe official refused to give any details, saying she did not want to comment before the evaluation process was completed. However, she was not very optimistic about the project’s chances of getting the green light from the European Commission: “There is no mirror project in Bulgaria and this could be a problem.” In conclusion, the modernisation of the Romania-Bulgaria rail links remains in suspense for the time being.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(405,'Railway PRO','TX Logistik orders 40 Vectrons','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/tx-logistik-orders-40-vectrons/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mobility-FS-Group-326x245.jpeg','May 11, 2023','2023-09-20 17:10:09','Siemens Mobility and FS Italiane Group, together with its subsidiary TX Logistik AG, have signed a contract for the delivery of a 40 Vectron locomotive fleet.

The new design offers enhanced passenger features such as wider table space, reclined chairs, individual armrests, reading light and charging facilities on each seat. Furthermore, the IC5 train will have more screens than on the current DSB trains, providing passengers enhanced real-time journey information availability.\nMinor changes are expected before full completion of the design. Nevertheless, the 1:1 scale IC5 train mock-up offers a strong impression of what customers and employees can expect from the real thing.\n“We have reached an important milestone together with Alstom. The IC5 trains will be the backbone of climate-friendly, comfortable and efficient train traffic in Denmark in a few years. With the design of the trainsets finally frozen in, production of the IC5 trains can begin,” Flemming Jensen, CEO of Danish State Railways said.\nThe five-car IC5 trains are adapted to meet the requirements of the Danish rail network and its top speed of 200 km/h will help ensure swift mobility across the country. They are prerequisites for being able to take full advantage of the major infrastructure projects on the railway that are currently being carried out, such as electrification and new signals.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nMaterials in the new IC5 trains are all inspired from Danish design tradition and offer, among other things, seat fabric with a high proportion of wool, which means that the seats will avoid environmentally harmful surface treatment. In addition, all products and materials are eco-labelled and up to 96% of the train can be recycled. The carriages have low entry, good flex areas for bicycles and prams, and even more places for storing luggage than the existing trains.\nThe IC5 Coradia Stream train “combines innovation, sustainability, and great passenger comfort in the best possible way. The details of the train are customised for Denmark, so there is no train like this elsewhere,” Emmanuel Henry, Managing Director of Alstom in Denmark said.\nThe IC5 trains, with 300 seats, will replace the IC3, IC4, IR4 and Øresund trains which will be continuously phased out, and will operate as both high-speed, intercity and regional trains.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(407,'Railway PRO','EUR 1.2 billion contract for another Palermo – Catania section','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/eur-1-2-billion-contract-for-another-section-of-palermo-catania-line/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Webuild_Palermo-Catania-line-326x245.jpg','May 11, 2023','2023-09-20 17:10:17','A consortium of Webuild (75%) and Ghella (25%) won a EUR 1.2 billion contract to upgrade the Caltanissetta Xirbi – Nuova Enna rail line (Lot 4A) of the Palermo – Catania – Messina railway in Sicily.\nThe contract covering the design and construction of 27 km is commissioned by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) and financed by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR in Italian).\nThe Lot 4a project covers a new rail next to the existing one, including four tunnels totalling 20 km of tunnels, of which 90% excavated by tunnel-boring machines. Three kilometres of the line will be across viaducts.

The project is to be completed by 2025 and will be financed from the funds of the Masovian Voivodeship.\nThe selected contractor will be responsible for developing the necessary documentation for a 5.5 km double-track section between Modlin and the airport, 40 km north of central Warsaw, and for the construction of a new stop next to the airport.As part of the documentation, a project will be developed to reconstruct the road system in Nowy Dwór town, including the construction of collision-free two-level intersections at the junction of the railway line with national road No. 62.The contractor will also be responsible for obtaining administrative decisions, including building permits.\nThanks to this project, the inhabitants of the Mazowieckie will gain fast and convenient rail connections from the Modlin station to the Mazowiecki Airport (MPL) Warszawa/Modlin and the center of the capital. The investment will also enable the creation of direct connections between Warsaw airports – Chopin Airport – Mazowiecki Airport (MPL) Warsaw/Modlin with an estimated travel time of about 45 minutes.\nThe development of the documentation will be financed from the Masovian Voivodeship’s own funds provided on the basis of an agreement concluded between PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe and the Marshal’s Office of the Masovian Voivodeship signed in February 2023.\nThe completion of the design documentation and obtaining a building permit for the new connection are scheduled for 2025, which will enable construction to commence in the following years.\nThe construction of a new train stop to provide convenient connection to the airport in Radom is also part of PLK’s air-rail access improvements. On April 28, PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe and City of Radom signed a contract with Trakcja for the construction of a new Radom Wschodni stop. This will allow for better use of railways in the city and increased communication to the Warsaw Radom Airport situated 3 km east of Radom city centre and 100 km from Warsaw. The investment will be implemented as part of a large task together with the City of Radom. The value of the contract for the stop is approx. PLN 39 million (EUR 8.6 million) and it is financed from the state budget.\nUnder the contract, construction works also include a platform and a road viaduct over the tracks along theŻeromski and Lubelska road.The Radom Wschodni stop will facilitate commuting to work, school and the airport.\nAt the Radom Wschodni stop, there is an island platform adapted to the needs of people with reduced mobility and passengers with heavy luggage using the airport.Access from the platform to the road viaduct will be possible via fixed stairs, escalators and lifts.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nFor the convenience of passengers, the new facility will be equipped with shelters, benches and handrails. The station will be equipped with legible markings, passenger information system, LED lighting, sound system and monitoring as well as bicycle racks placed at the entrances to the platforms. There will be guided paths on the surface of the platform for the blind and visually impaired.\nAs part of preparations for the construction of the Radom Wschodni stop, in 2020-2022 PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe installed 9 additional turnouts within the viaduct at ul. Żeromskiego, which are to enable the exit from the Łuków – Radom Główny railway line (Line No. 26) to the Warszawa Zachodnia – Radom Główny railway (Line No. 8) and carried out additional construction works related to the reconstruction of underground installations needed for the future construction of the platform.\nThe construction of the platform at the viaduct over Żeromskiego street in Radom is expected to start this month and the completion is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025.\n“Better commuting to work and school, greater access to trains are the effects of investments that have been implemented on the Radom – Warsaw line.

Legislation is needed to create Great British Railways (GBR), which will bring track and train operations together within one body.\nThe proposed legislation has been delayed since the Government published its reform proposals in 2021 and the rail business leaders are concerned that failure to legislate within the next Parliamentary session means the railway will have no clear direction. This uncertainty about the future structure of the industry threatens a hiatus in key decisions being made, jeopardising progress with essential rail works, jobs, investment and business growth, and ultimately undermining services for passengers and freight customers.\nThe acceleration of British rail reform “will help provide the certainty rail businesses need to invest, take on staff and develop their business plans, ultimately benefiting passenger and freight customers, and resulting in better value-for-money for taxpayers,” RIA Chief Executive Darren Caplan said, adding that the “failure to enact the GBR legislation means a delay to reform of at least 18 months.”\nThe establishment of the Great British Railways (GBR) is part of the Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail strategy establishing a new rail industry structure to “bring the railways back together, delivering\nmore punctual and reliable services.”\nThe letter says that “the UK railway and the economy cannot afford to see work stop whilst GBR is set up.” The letter includes “five tests” for GBR highlighting the key areas which the new organisation will need to focus on to ensure the restructuring is a success.\nThe first test is referring to the necessity of a continuously work without disconnections. Under Control Period 6 ending in 2024, the Government’s investment programme includes GBP 18.8 billion (EUR 21.6 billion) renewals to sustain the network and GBP 9.5 billion (EUR 10.9 billion) in enhancements planned, alongside a number of rolling stock orders. However, “there is no clarity about what is planned beyond 2024” and rapid decisions to be taken for renewals and enhancements under CP 7 (2024-2029) are essential to launch tenders preparing the investments to be made for 2024-2029 period.\nAt the same time, the industry is committed to decarbonise rail passenger transport by 2050 requiring further electrification and procurement of sustaianble rolling stock as well as deploying digital signalling techology. “Delays to any of this work will detrimentally impact both passenger and freight rail services, and limit the rail supply sector’s ability to support the economic recovery post-Coronavirus. Any hiatus in work would halt investment and make it more difficult for the industry to retain and hire workers,” the letter says.\nThe second test calls for transparency with rail suppliers when establishing GBR needs considering that a large amount of the Government’s spend on rail is delivered by private sector companies, with significant invested capital. An open approach will allow suppliers to plan their projects and investments in R&D, people, plant and processes and to deliver ever more efficiently.  “The\nprocess needs to be transparent too, with clear roles for Government, GBR, ORR and the supply industry, as set out in the Williams-Shapps Plan.”\nPartnership is the third test included in the letter and calls for an open interface between the private sector and GBR which should set out clearly where the private sector will be involved and where work will be conducted in-house.\nProductivity and ambition are the last two tests that underline the need to ensure that the industry will thrive while the entire rail sector should leave a positive legacy, including in safety, decarbonisation, exports and the economy.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(410,'Railway PRO','Shortlisted for Surrey Langley SkyTrain systems contract','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/shortlisted-for-surrey-langley-skytrain-systems-contract/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Surrey-Skytrain-326x245.jpg','May 10, 2023','2023-09-20 17:10:34','The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure of British Columbia announced the three shortlisted consortia to design, build and install the electrical systems and trackwork for the Surrey Langley SkyTrain.\nFollowing the evaluation of the submissions, the teams invited to participate in the request for proposals (RFP) stage are:\nTransit Integrators BC\n\nGraham Infrastructure\nSNC-Lavalin Major Projects\nSNC-Lavalin\nWestern Pacific Enterprises\n\nSurrey Langley SkyTrain Connectors\n\nAecon Infrastructure Management\nSICE Canada\nParsons\n\nKiewit Infrastructure BC ULC\n\nKiewit Infrastructure BC ULC\nMass.

The authority expects that the operator licences for both lines, or for only JRL, to be awarded by the end of 2024. “This would provide sufficient time for operators to ramp up their operations before the initial phases of these lines commence passenger service in 2027 and 2030 respectively,” LTA says. If only the JRL tender is awarded in this round, LTA will appoint the CRL operator at a later juncture.\nThe successful tenderers will be paid a service fee to operate and maintain the mass transit lines for the first licensing period of 9 years, with the possibility of a two-year extension. During the first licensing period of the JRL and CRL, the Government of Singapore will bear fare revenue risk under the same model as the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), given the higher fare revenue and ridership uncertainty in the initial years of operation for such new lines.\nUpon the expiry of the licence, LTA will review the model for subsequent rail operator licences, taking into consideration the viability and ridership of the lines.\nLTA says that the tender will be limited to existing rail operators in Singapore the SMRT Trains and SBS Transit Rail. Foreign operators will be allowed to participate in the JRL and CRL operator tenders as minority partners of joint ventures with SMRT Trains or SBS Transit Rail. The calibrated participation of foreign operators will strengthen our domestic operators’ capabilities in operation and maintenance.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe tenders to appoint the operators for JRL and CRL lines will be called concurrently. Nonetheless, each bid for each line will be assessed on its own merits, including quality and price. This approach increases the value of the tender and encourages both bidders to submit more competitive bids by taking into account potential savings in the event both lines are operated by the same operator.\nThe 24 km elevated Jurong Region Line (JRL) with 24 stations, including three interchange stations, will open from 2027 onwards, in three stages improving connectivity in the western part of Singapore by establishing direct links to Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Jurong Industrial Estate, Jurong Innovation District, Pandan Reservoir and the future Tengah area. In mid-January, LTA has started the construction works for JRL.\nThe Cross Island Line (CRL) will connect major hubs that are under development in the eastern, western, and north-eastern parts of Singapore such as Jurong Lake District, Punggol Digital District and Changi region. The CRL will be Singapore’s longest fully underground line with a total length of more than 50 km.

The new locomotives are intended to deliver rail freight services. In the coming weeks, the other three are scheduled to enter commercial operation. The purchase of the five units involved an investment of EUR 30.2 million.\nThe new metre gauge locomotives, which will replace the existing diesel ones of the 254 series, are dual system and will allow electric and diesel traction.\nSpecifically, they will run with electric traction in the sections that currently have catenary (the Manresa – Martorell – Sant Boi rail line), and diesel in the rest of the sections. The fact of having a dual power supply and traction with electricity will reduce the emission and noise, compared to a traction vehicles with a combustion engine.\nThus, they will make it possible to reduce diesel consumption by between 57% and 66% and will mean a global reduction in pollutant emissions of 66%. Along the same lines, the new rolling stock will be 95% recyclable.\nThe new 257 series locomotives that are 20-metre-long and 3.9 meters high with a weigh of 90 tonnes, incorporate several improvements over the 254 locomotives of the 1990s, among them reliability, the regenerative electric brake, the automatic traction change and noise reduction as well as technological and also ergonomic improvements for the driving staff.\nThe acquired locomotives will be used for the rail transport of potassium salts to the Suria salt mining area of the ICL company and the vehicles from the SEAT factory in Martorell, will perform unloading activities at the port of Barcelona. The transport of goods provided by Ferrocarrils allows to promote sustainable transport as it favors transport by rail instead of by road. Last year it made it possible to eliminate 29,076 journeys by truck.\nThe Martorell Operations CenCentreter (COM), located next to the Martorell Enllaç de Ferrocarrils station, is the reference centre within the railway service of the Llobregat – Anoia metre gauge line linking Barcelona with the Baix Llobregat, Bages and Anoia regions in Catalonia.\nIn 2021, the new COM building was inaugurated, resulting from the reorganisation of the complex that FGC had at this station, and works were carried out on the track beach and improvements to the catenary and railway signalling. At the same time, activities for urban integration were carried out around the COM site, which allowed the consolidation of the buildings and arrangement for a new car park for FGC staff. The various actions carried out have turned the complex into a first-class infrastructure to face the leap in scale that the Llobregat – Anoia line service will make in the coming years.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(420,'Railway PRO','UITP Summit: Professor Mariana Mazzucato announced as keynote speaker!','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/uitp-summit-professor-mariana-mazzucato-announced-as-keynote-speaker/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mariana-Mazzucato-326x245.jpg','May 8, 2023','2023-09-20 17:11:21','Professor Mariana Mazzucato, named as “one of the most important thinkers on innovation” by the New Republic, will take the stage at the UITP Global Public Transport Summit 2023 as keynote speaker.\nInternationally recognised for her work on the dynamics of technological change, the role of the public sector in innovation, and the concept of value in economics, she is known for turning economic ideas into policy.\nMariana Mazzucato’s reputation and knowledge has led to numerous high-level policy roles across the globe, and her ideas heard and read in numerous international outlets, on broadcast and in print.\nAs the defining event in the world of urban mobility, the UITP Global Summit has an important agenda for the sector: and that requires the very best voices to drive that direction.\nHeld across four days in Barcelona, on 4-7 June 2023, it is the gathering of the sector’s most important names and faces, brought together to discuss how best to define the future of public transport.\nMariana Mazzucato is a conversation starter, whose advice to policy makers around the world on innovation-led inclusive and sustainable growth, has led her to become one of the most sought-after speakers across the globe.\nShe is internationally respected for her extensive research and policy work, with her particular areas of interest being innovative-led growth, collective value financing, structural change, mission-oriented policy, purpose driven corporate governance, and from the public good to the common good.\nAs an educator, Professor Mariana Mazzucato, PhD teaches the Economics of Innovation and Public Value at the University College London, where she is the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose.\nAs an author, she has written four highly-acclaimed books, The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths, The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy, and Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism, the first published in 2013; the most recent The Big Con: How the Consulting Industry Weakens our Business, Infantilises our Governments and Warps our Economies, published just this year.\nAs an adviser, she brings her experience and insight to numerous high-level roles, including Chair of the World Health Organisation’s Council on the Economics of Health for All, Co-Chair on the Council on Urban Initiatives, and the OECD High-Level Advisory Panel on Climate and Economic Resilience.\nPublic transport is a sector full of innovation, redefinition and ongoing transformation.\nAnd like many sectors, we know that we must consider all possibilities to truly embrace the most innovative, accessible, and exciting future for our cities and those who call them home.\nBringing together over 300 speakers across 85 Congress sessions, almost 400 exhibitors across 40,000m2 of space, the UITP Global Summit for 2023 will be held under the theme “Bright Light of the City”.\nWith technical visits, innovative tours, networking and social events, it is the leading global platform for all public transport professionals.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(421,'Railway PRO','Excavation completed for one tunnel of Paris metro line 16','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/excavation-completed-for-one-tunnel-of-paris-metro-line-16/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPE-TMB-Mireille-Breakthrough_edited_0-326x245.jpg','May 8, 2023','2023-09-20 17:11:25','Webuild and NGE completed the excavation of a tunnel of Paris Line 16 of Grand Paris Express after the TBM Mireille ended its journey with breakthrough in shaft at Mare au Chanvre site in municipality of Sevran.

As part of the joint development of the new MagRail system capabilities, the newly introduced Booster components, being a part of the already known MagRail system, will be installed on conventional freight wagons supplied by GATX Rail Europe and then tested on rail infrastructure equipped with the system’s trackside devices.\nMagRail Booster is part of the MagRail product portfolio and allows for a quick retrofit of existing rail cars with linear motor propulsion. Other MagRail products, dedicated both to freight and passenger transport, require new vehicles.\nNevomo’s MagRail Booster technology addresses the freight and logistics transport challenges faced by railway operators, terminal operators, and rail infrastructure managers. One key advantage of this system is that single Booster wagons can operate independently without being connected to the locomotive. This opens up possibilities for new applications in which wagons can be organised into small groups instead of full trainsets. This feature is particularly useful in “last mile” areas, such as terminals and industrial facilities, where a high degree of flexibility and movement automation is highly desirable.\n“We are very proud to have GATX – one of the leading railcar lessors in Europe – as our partner for developing and testing the MagRail Booster technology. The first retrofits are already ongoing, and we will see the first fully electrified and automatic GATX MagRail Booster wagon on our test track this year,” Stefan Kirch, Chief Business Development Officer at Nevomo.\nThe cooperation between the companies will allow for testing on Nevomo’s test track in Nowa Sarzyna using conventional freight wagons and further development of the new functionality of the MagRail system.\n“The attractiveness of Nevomo’s MagRail Booster technology is an opportunity to upgrade existing railways, both in terms of the infrastructure and the rolling stock. This will enable railways to grow faster, grow their capacity, which is urgently needed for sustainable and performant logistics, but at the same time to remain compatible and interoperable with the current operations,” Jörg Nowaczyk, Chief Commercial Officer at GATX Rail Europe said.\nMagRail was designed to easily, quickly and cost-effectively extend the capacity of existing railway lines and increase efficiency in rail transport. The MagRail Booster has been developed to improve existing rail services allowing traffic automation and infrastructure electrification with higher flexibility, greater capacity, and enhanced dynamics.\nPotential applications of MagRail Booster with retrofitted rolling stock for freight are currently being evaluated by major European railway companies, on increasing loading limits on inclines or quicker re-acceleration of freight trains after being passed by faster passenger trains. This concept allows railway traffic in non-electrified tunnels and under low-clearance bridges.\nBoth companies are committed to taking rail transport to a whole new dimension by combining proven solutions, used in rail transport, with state-of-the-art technologies, inspired by the hyperloop. The technology created by Nevomo is the missing link between the existing railway infrastructure and the brand-new digital railway systems. Its rapid, successful deployment and use on Europe’s rail network will not only bring significant benefits to operators and rail infrastructure managers but will support the European Green Deal’s objectives and modernizing rail transport, which remains a priority for the European Union.\nTo implement and test its new MagRail technology, Nevomo signed agreements with Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, duisport, and SNCF. The first 1:5 demo version of MagRail Nevomo was presented in 2019. Successful mid-size tests were conducted in December 2020 and in 2022, Nevomo completed the construction of the full-scale test track in Nowa Sarzyna in Poland, which is Europe’s longest track for testing passive magnetic levitation. The first tests already began and will be now extended to the MagRail Booster tests with the conventional freight wagons on MagRail infrastructure.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(423,'Railway PRO','TfW and Global Centre of Rail Excellence sign agreement','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/tfw-and-global-centre-of-rail-excellence-sign-agreement/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TfW-Simon-Jones-and-James-Price-326x245.jpg','May 8, 2023','2023-09-20 17:11:33','Transport for Wales (TfW) and GCRE Limited have signed heads of terms for TfW to become a major commercial client of the Global Centre of Rail Excellence (GCRE).\nThe Global Centre of Rail Excellence is a GBP 400 million (EUR 454 million) research, testing and certification facility for rolling stock, infrastructure and innovative new rail technologies being constructed at the head of the Dulais and Swansea Valleys.\nAs part of the GCRE membership model, companies can take guaranteed testing and research time at the site when it opens, according to their innovation needs.\nThe agreement demonstrates TfW’s intent to take the highest level of membership at GCRE and become a ‘Premium’ client of the facility, due to be completed in 2025.

Liverpool Street is the busiest station in the UK by footfall, with up to 135 million people using the station and concourse area annually in recent years. In spite of high passenger volumes, it operates with just half the concourse space of similar London stations which results in overcrowding during peak times.\nIt is proposed a GBP 450 million (EUR 510.9 million) investment for station upgrades and customer requirements, resulting in a greatly improved passenger experience at no cost to the tax or farepayer, the three companies say. Passengers are at the centre of the proposals, and the design allows the station to remain open and operational throughout all phases of the project construction.\nThe innovative net zero design creates over 800,000 sq ft of offices and around 160,000 sq ft of hotel space using the airspace above the 1990s elements of the station and 40 Liverpool Street.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe office component of the development has been designed to address the lack of supply for modern Grade A space in the City of London with strong environmental and wellness credentials that can accommodate changes to working habits that have accelerated as a result of the pandemic.\nThe project also sensitively protects the station and hotel’s unique historic features. The Victorian trainsheds will be restored and will not be touched or built over as part of this project. The newly proposed station concourse will preserve these valuable heritage structures by opening up incredible new views of them throughout the station. Local and street level views will be retained by visually setting back the commercial building comfortably from the historic façades of the Grade II* listed 40 Liverpool Street.\nThe proposals include the creation of over 1.5 acres of public realm in and around the main station building and Hope Square as well as the pedestrianisation of Liverpool Street.\nThe highlight is a new public rooftop garden with natural planting, which has been designed to offer the local community new amenities and sports facilities that do not currently exist. A four lane, 25 metre City Lido heated by surplus heat from the offices will allow swimmers to enjoy open air swimming all year round and a padel court will become the first in the City of London. Both will be available to the public, including local schools; and a rooftop café, with outstanding views over the City and to St. Paul’s, will also be open to visitors.\nA cultural and placemaking strategy has been at the forefront of the design of the public spaces to create a seven-days-a-week destination. Importantly, it ensures that the public realm is a dynamic and engaging place, with a range of activities and events that will draw visitors and serve as a hub for arts, entertainment, and community activities, creating a vibrant and lively environment.\nA new six-storey hotel at the top of the building will be a destination for international and domestic visitors, and includes a venue that can host conferences, talks, lectures, and live music. The hotel will continue to be part of the Hyatt’s Andaz brand, offering a quality hotel experience for the City of London.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(428,'Railway PRO','EUR 790 million in grants for military mobility','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/eur-790-million-in-grants-for-military-mobility/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pkp-freight-terespol-326x245.jpg','May 4, 2023','2023-09-20 17:12:00','The European Commission on Wednesday launched a call for proposals under the Connecting Europe Facility, making EUR 790 million available for projects addressing civilian and military needs. Military mobility is on the EC’s radar.\n\nWith this call, the EU is accelerating investment in military mobility and supporting infrastructure projects that facilitate the transport of troops and equipment on its main transport axes.\n“We are making EUR 790 million available for projects that will promote the mixed use of our transport system. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine has confirmed that we need to continue to improve the capacity of transport infrastructures such as roads, bridges and railways to allow armed forces and their equipment to move easily across the EU,” said Transport Commissioner Adina Vălean.\nThis call for tenders also responds to the measures proposed in the Military Mobility Action Plan 2.0. This plan aims to facilitate the movement of armed forces across Europe to respond quickly and better to crises at the EU’s external borders and beyond.\nMilitary mobility in the EC spotlight\nThe European Commission proposed at the end of 2022 a plan to improve mobility in the European Union, including measures in the field of transport and rail infrastructure. In December 2022 a decision was made to increase the CEF budget for military mobility to support the implementation of 35 projects.\n“Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine has confirmed the urgent need to substantially increase the military mobility of armed forces inside and outside the Union,” the European Commission argues in the introduction to the plan.\nThe Military Mobility Action Plan 2.0 responds to this desire, say the authors of the document released in Brussels on Thursday.\nCurrently, transport systems within Europe are characterised by limitations, such as different rail systems between Ukraine and EU member states, as well as within the European Union. These limitations have prevented optimal mobility solutions.\nThe heavy reliance on contracted civil transport solutions has also become evident. A strategic approach is needed to ensure the coherence of these actions. The strategic approach of this Action Plan focuses on the need to develop a well-connected military mobility network consisting of multimodal transport corridors, including roads, railways, air routes and inland waterways with dual-use transport infrastructure capable of serving military transport.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(429,'Railway PRO','PKP Cargo takes delivery of the last 5 Vectrons','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/pkp-cargo-takes-delivery-of-the-last-5-vectrons/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Nowe-lokomotywy-Vectron-PKP-CARGO-5-326x245.jpg','May 4, 2023','2023-09-20 17:12:05','PKP Cargo has taken delivery of 5 Vectron MS locomotives from Siemens Mobility bringing its entire Vectron MS fleet to 25 units which allows Polish operator to provide cross-border transport services.\nIn September 2015, the company decided to sign with Siemens Mobility a contract for the delivery of 15 units, and in 2019 it exercised its option to purchase a further 5 electric locomotives. In 2022, the operator purchased another 5 vehicles, this time for the development of intermodal transport in Poland and Europe. Now the contract has been finalized and the last Vectron locomotives have been received.\n“Every year PKP Cargo allocates most of its investment funds to the purchase and modernisation of rolling stock, as this is how we take care of increasing the company’s operational capabilities and, consequently, our competitiveness. The current purchase of the Vectron MS fleet is aimed at increasing PKP Cargo’s capacity for intermodal transport in international traffic. This direction is very important for us, as one of PKP Cargo’s strategic goals is to develop international haulage, especially on the markets of the Tricity countries,“ Dariusz Seliga, the CEO of PKP Cargo said.\nIn addition to the purchase of locomotives, the company also signed a contract to acquire 220 platform wagons from the consortium of Wagony Świdnica and Astra Rail Industries, both part of the Greenbrier.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe agreement signed by PKP Cargo with the Centre for EU Transport Projects provides for the co-financing of the purchase of 220 wagons-platforms for container transport and five multi-system locomotives from funds of the Cohesion Fund under the Infrastructure and Environment Programme. The value of both contracts amounts to approximately PLN 243.5 million net (EUR 52.9 million), of which almost PLN 92.4 million (EUR 20 million) is the EU co-financing.\n“Once again, we have the opportunity to see how European Funds support the development of PKP Cargo. Thanks to the effective use of OPIŚ funds, the company is modernising its rolling stock through the purchase of intermodal platforms and modern multi-system locomotives, such as Vectron. We are particularly pleased with the prospect of further development of rail freight transport, which is an element of Poland’s sustainable and ecological transport system,“ Joanna Lech, Director at the Centre for EU Transport Projects, said.\nThe Vectrons are the most modern universal locomotives on the European market, with a modular design enabling easy adaptation to the requirements of use and specifics of running in different countries and different operating conditions. The locomotive was developed with a variety of transport tasks in mind. The basic premise for the construction of the vehicle was the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the traction tasks in national and cross-border traffic, both for passengers and passengers. and cross-border passenger and freight traffic in Europe.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nThe Vectron MS fleet purchased by PKP Cargo has a power output of 6.4 MW in AC power and 6.0 MW in DC power, and have been equipped with an ETCS system in accordance with the current specifications (Baseline 3). They are approved for Poland, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, with the Vectron platform vehicles – the only modern locomotives in Europe – being approved for operation in as many as 20 European countries.\n“Vectrons are unique vehicles that are able to cross European rail borders without stopping. This is an important element which builds PKP Cargo‘s competitive advantage not only in Poland, but also throughout Europe. The lack of stops at the border means savings in rolling stock and driver time, lower energy consumption and significant benefits for the environment,“ Hubert Meronk, CEO of Siemens Mobility Sp. z o.o. said.\nIn addition to the delivery of the electric locomotives, the agreement with PKP Cargo also covers the full maintenance of all 5 vehicles until the first periodic repair at the P4 level (8 years), together with an option to perform this repair. In addition, Siemens Mobility will provide software to support the operation of the locomotives and a set of brand new spare parts and components included in the so-called anti-failure kit.\n \n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(430,'Railway PRO','Rail sector needs a common approach to phase out diesel fuel','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/rail-sector-needs-a-common-approach-to-phase-out-diesel-fuel/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PKP-PLK-326x245.jpg','May 4, 2023','2023-09-20 17:12:15','The entire rail sector needs to design a common strategy to address the challenge of transitioning from fossil diesel, a study of Association of European Rail Rolling Stock Lessors (AERRL) says.\nThe report has been conducted by eolos and was launched together with Akiem, Beacon and Cargounit, with support from Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, KfW IPEX-Bank and Societe Generale.\nBased on the results of the study, AEERL has shared an initial roadmap of technology alternatives for the years to 2050 when transport emissions must fall by 90% compared to 1990 levels, in accordance with the European Commission’s Green Deal target.\nTo achieve the reduction of CO2 emissions and increase its market share, the rail sector needs to design a process for phasing out diesel fuel if it is to remain the most sustainable form of land transport.\nThe study says that while electrification remains the most efficient solution to accelerate decarbonization, HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil/ advanced bio diesel) is rated as an immediate candidate. It can reduce CO2 emissions by 85 to 90 percent and is easy to implement. The renewable natural gas and Ammonia ICE are considered short- to medium-term options, though several operational challenges remain.\nGreen hydrogen is also a solution but is still very limited one and requires high expenditure. It is used as an option for applications where no other solution is available such as on the long non-electrified routes but requires substantial infrastructure improvements.\nThough major problems remain, battery technology is a solution for the rail sector. Dual-mode battery/electric trains combined with partial electrification for the longer term could become a game-changer, the study underlines.\nTo enable the sustainable transition of the rail sector, the different stakeholders need to come together in a “freight transport system for efficiency” organised either by the Commission or an appointed actor in the field. The investments between rolling stock and infrastructure need to be balanced.\nTo achieve maximum leverage for industrial decarbonisation, the rail sector should be, after pipelines, the first choice for green hydrogen transport. With such a position in a new supply chain, the rail sector can increase its freight market share and provide safe and reliable low\ncarbon-emission energy to today’s most emissive industries.\n“An ambitious and aligned roadmap for near-term decarbonisation is currently the missing link in European policy. HVO can contribute very easily to short-term decarbonisation of existing diesel-powered fleets. Battery-electric technology seems to be a likely game-changer for the medium and long term. Hydrogen, and potentially ammonia, could be later alternative solutions for heavy freight trains where infrastructure electrification, even partial is not available and batteries not suitable,” Fabien Rochefort, AERRL chair said.\n \nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(431,'Railway PRO','Captrain orders EURO6000 locomotives','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/captrain-orders-euro6000-locomotives/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Captrain-326x245.jpg','May 4, 2023','2023-09-20 17:12:19','Stadler Valencia and Captrain España signed a contract for the supply of eight EURO6000 multi-voltage electric locomotives which will be able to run on both standard gauge and Iberian gauge tracks.

In January 2023, Sydney Metro awarded Hyundai Movex a contract to design, supply and install 150 mechanical gap fillers at stations being converted to metro standards on the Bankstown Line. The new mechanical gap filler technology works automatically, extending quickly from the platform to the train before the platform screen doors open, allowing safe and easy access for all customers. Under the contract Hyundai Movex is also responsible for the delivery of 360 platform screen doors to be installed at 8 stations on the Bankstown line.

ÖBB invested around EUR 28 million together with the municipality of Golling to deliver increased capacity and train speed along the line. With the new works, train speed increased from 90 km/h to 110 km/h.\nThe construction of the two underpasses is also increasing road safety in Golling. The new Wasserfallstraße underpass replaces the previous railway crossing in the town centre. This will significantly improve traffic flow in the area. A new sidewalk, spatially separated from the road offers pedestrians a safe connection between the two districts. The previously single-lane, poorly visible and more than 90-year-old Moartalstraße underpass was also rebuilt. Road users benefit from significantly better visibility and thus greater safety. For pedestrians, a sidewalk that is spatially separated from the road was also built here.\n\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n			\n				\n			\n		\n\nAt the same time, a synergy effect was used with the construction of the Wasserfallstrasse underpass. Until now, the area of the level crossing formed a gap in noise protection which now has been closed with the construction of  continuous, state-of-the-art noise protection walls. “Safer, quieter and faster: We are pleased that we have implemented an infrastructure measure for future generations with the Golling line improvement,” Christian Höss, ÖBB project manager said.\nSince October 2020, work has been constantly underway to upgrade the line in the local area of\nGolling. The works were essential to expand the railway line from Salzburg to Villach, with the primary goal of cutting journey times between Villach and Salzburg to 145 minutes. Key project elements of the line upgrade in Golling were the closing of the railway crossing (at Wasserfallstraße) and construction of a road and pedestrian underpass as well as the construction of a new underpass at Moartalstraße (Ramslstraße), along with the closure of the Durchlassstrasse underpass.\nShare on:',NULL,NULL,1),(439,'Railway PRO','European Commission investigation into Renfe ‘s practices','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/european-commission-investigation-into-renfe-s-practices/','https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Renfe-Cercanias-326x245.jpg','May 2, 2023','2023-09-20 17:12:56','The European Commission has opened a formal investigation to assess whether Renfe may have abused its dominant position in the Spanish rail passenger market by refusing to provide all content and real-time data to rival ticketing platforms.\n\nRenfe is Spain’s traditional state-owned rail operator. Renfe sells its tickets offline and online either directly through its websites and apps (i.e. Renfe and Cercanías) and mobility platform (i.e. dōcō), or indirectly through third-party ticketing platforms.\nThird-party ticketing platforms are companies that offer online ticketing services to customers via apps or websites (i.e. online travel agents).\nThe Commission is concerned that Renfe may have restricted competition in the Spanish market for online rail ticketing services by refusing to provide third party ticketing platforms with: full information on its range of tickets, discounts and features but also real-time data (before the journey, during the journey or after the journey) related to its rail passenger services.\nRenfe currently provides real-time content and data on its own websites and apps, but may have refused to provide direct access to all this information to third-party ticketing platforms. Third-party ticketing platforms display offers from different rail carriers and provide online customer search, comparison, booking and payment services. These platforms must have access to all Renfe content and real-time data in order to adapt their offers to customers’ needs.\nThe Commission is concerned that Renfe’s alleged refusal to provide this content and real-time data may prevent platforms from competing with Renfe’s own direct digital channels, to the detriment of consumers. If proven, the conduct under investigation may violate EU competition rules, which prohibit abuse of a dominant position (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Commission will now conduct its in-depth investigation as a matter of priority.\nIn parallel to the opening of proceedings, the Commission has adopted a preliminary assessment summarising the main facts of the case and identifying its competition concerns.

The new design for electronic platform signs and line access indicators has already been in operation since the end of March at Basel CFF and Biel/Bienne stations. On this occasion, opinion polls were conducted among passengers for two weeks on the change. As the result was positive, all line access indicators and electronic panels on the platforms will be replaced by new generation ones from 2 May 2023. The general signage, installed at strategic locations at stations, will adopt the new visual identity by this summer.\nNew functions displayed on information boards in Swiss railway stations\nIn some stations, line access signs are placed high up near stairs, lifts and ramps. The new grey-coloured information bar indicates the sectors in which the carriages are located (e.g. 1st class, 2nd class or restaurant car).\nOn the other hand, a directional arrow to the left or right of the train indicates the nearest access. Trains with different final destinations are marked with a distinct colour and an explanatory text to make them easier to identify. From now on, the track access indicator additionally shows the next trains for a 25-minute interval and the respective platform.\nCFF currently has two generations of equipment in stations.

Under these projects, travellers from Myślenice, Niepołomice and Olkusz cities can reach Krakow quickly and comfortably by train.\nIn the case of the construction of a 4 km railway link on the Kraków – Olkusz route, 29 months from the date of signing the contract will be required to complete the task. The preparation of the design for the new Kraków – Niepołomice line is expected to take 32 months. The largest scope of works awaits the contractors of the project for the railway line to Myślenice. In this case, PLK SA expects 35 months to perform the contract.\nThe construction of the Borowa Górka – Pieczyska railway link will shorten the travel time by 15 minutes from Kraków to Olkusz, 40 km north from the region’s capital. Thanks to the new tracks, the operators will not have to turn back at the station in Jaworzno Szczakowa. In addition, the residents of Bukowno a town in Olkusz County will also benefit from a faster connection to Krakow. Access to rail transport will increase due to the construction of the Jaworzno Sosina stop. Trains will travel at a speed of 80 km/h on the new double-track line. In March, PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe and the government of Lesser Poland Voivodeship signed financing contracts for two rail projects totalling EUR 114.2 million allowing the construction of Olkusz – Krakow rail connection.\nThe project to link Myślenice and Krakow’s Swoszowice district a 22 km rail line is planned to be constructed including two tunnels and seven stops (in Lusina, Konary, Olszowice, Kąty, Krzyszkowice, Polanka and Myślenice).The facilities will be adapted to the needs of people with reduced mobility.The trains in the difficult foothill terrain will travel at a speed of 80 to 120 km/h.The journey from Krakow to Myślenice is estimated to take about 40 minutes.\nThe project for the new 6 km line between Niepołomice and Krakow will provide inhabitants increased access to region’s rail services. The selected variant includes the construction of a new track from Podgrabia, a district of Gmina Okonek, within Złotów County, to the centre of Niepołomice, 28 km east of Kraków. The trains will run at up to 80 km/h along the new line served by three stops (MAN, Boryczów and Niepołomice). Passengers will take only 30 minutes to travel from Niepołomice to Krakow city centre.\nKolej Plus in Lesser Poland involves the implementation of four selected projects covering activities for 63 km of rail links out of which 32 km will be new lines (from Kraków to the three above mentioned cities). For another 31 km existing line (Gorlice – Jasło line on mainline No. 108) revitalisation works and the construction of a connection with the No.110 rail line are planned.\n“The government program Kolej Plus is a programme for the construction and reconstruction of railway lines in Polish regions. This is the first programme in history under which the government co-finances investments indicated and reported by local governments. Preparatory work is going according to plan,” the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk said.\nThe Kolej Plus programme has a total value of PLN 13.2 billion (EUR 2.9 billion) of which PLN 11.2 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) is the national budget while PLN 2 billion (EUR 436 million) is the funding provided by the local governments. The new programme will provide cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants new or better rail connections to the railway system. Kolej Plus has been designed especially for cities or towns who do not currently have passenger rail links or need to improve their connections. Thanks to the implementation of Kolej Plus, 1.5 million inhabitants will gain better access to rail passenger services.\nIn April, the government of Poland has announced that 34 rail projects have been selected under the Koplej Plus which includes improvements and construction for a total of 1,200 km of rail lines.

The project\'s successful completion marks the beginning of a new chapter in energy conservation in the rail transit industry and is solid evidence that Alstom has contributed to the high-quality growth of China\'s green and intelligent rail transit integration. \nANP\'s new generation silicon carbide and permanent magnet motor propulsion system adopts advanced technologies such as silicon carbide power devices with high-frequency, high-junction temperature, and low loss, as well as innovative technology of high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous motors. Thanks to the use of SIC and PMM technologies, 30% of energy is saved for train traction. On the other hand, during the design phase of the new converter, special attention was given to maintaining a similar level of reliability, while going from car control to single axle control.

This test campaign will last almost 6 months and is part of a long series of tests for this new generation of High Speed Trains. \nDecisive test campaigns for the admission of the train and its reliability\nThe TGV M test programme consists of the following phases:\n1. Static and quasi-static testing:\nEach piece of equipment on the train was first assessed separately to validate its own performance and service life. Then, once assembled, the test train was tested at Alstom\'s Bellevue site (in France) at a standstill and then at a speed not exceeding 30 km/h. The operation of all the equipment integrated into the train was checked, as were the interactions of this equipment with each other. \n2. Pre-validation testing:\nThe pre-validation tests are first conducted on the Velim site. This is a closed circuit where traffic is less constrained than on the national railway networks and, above all, there is no interaction with commercial traffic. The objectives here are to validate the overall operation of the train, to remove the risks that appeared during the design phase in relation to the regulatory requirements and to adjust the digital modelling accordingly. This phase takes place at speeds of up to 200 km/h.\nOn the basis of this sequence, the tests will then continue with traffic on the French national network. The overall operation of the train will be tested up to 320 km/h. \n3. Admission tests: \nThey consist of testing the operation by reproducing the configurations and contexts that the train may encounter throughout his entire life (degraded modes, weather conditions, obstacles on the network, etc.). They will be carried out on the French national network, with traffic up to 320 km/h by an accredited organisation. The admission tests will make it possible to obtain the Commercial Service Authorisation issued by the ERA (European Railways Agency).\n4. Endurance tests:\nOver a long period prior to commercial operation, several trainsets will run throughout the French national network to test the reliability of the train under real operating conditions. All functions will be tested, in particular those relating to passenger comfort. These tests will also be an opportunity for SNCF Voyageurs drivers and conductors to familiarise themselves with this new train and its innovations.\nAt the end of all these tests, the TGV M will have benefited from a total of 350 weeks of testing and will have covered more than a million kilometres before the first customer experiences the high-speed train of tomorrow.',NULL,NULL,1),(756,'Alstom','Alstom and RegioJet sign an agreement for the supply of another 13 Traxx MS3 locomotives','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2023/2/alstom-and-regiojet-sign-agreement-supply-another-13-traxx-ms3-locomotives','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2023/02/07/RegioJet_Traxx_MS3_Locomotives_2.jpg?itok=TWx7kMH3','08 Feb 2023','2023-09-20 16:51:24','Press contact - Czech Republic and Slovakia\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Kateřina Pištorová\n      \n              Send an email,Order of 13 Traxx multi-system locomotives \n\n\nAll locomotives will operate in the Central Europe region\n\n\nFebruary 8, 2023 – Alstom, a global leader in smart and sustainable mobility, has received an order from RegioJet, Central Europe\'s largest private rail passenger carrier, to supply 13 Traxx MS3 locomotives to be operated in the Central Europe region. \nThese new locomotives will be used for domestic and cross-border journeys on the electrified networks in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Germany.

During summer 2023, the Coradia iLint will carry passengers on the Réseau Charlevoix rail network, along the St. Lawrence River, between Parc de la Chute-Montmorency and Baie-St-Paul. The train will be powered by green hydrogen produced by Harnois Énergies at its Quebec City site. \nThe province of Quebec will be the first jurisdiction in the Americas to run a train with zero direct emissions powered by green hydrogen, demonstrating its leadership in the transition to a low-carbon economy and the set-up of ecosystems dedicated to hydrogen. The operation of this train with passengers on board will allow Alstom and its partners to better assess the subsequent steps for the development of hydrogen propulsion technology and its penetration into the North American market.\nThe Coradia iLint first entered commercial service in Germany in 2018 and has travelled more than 220,000 kilometres in eight European countries. The train is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell that emits only water vapour during operation, while ensuring a quieter environment for passengers and those close to tracks. On September 15, 2022, the Coradia iLint travelled the record distance of 1,175 kilometres without refuelling. Coradia iLint has a top speed of 140 km/h and acceleration and a braking performance comparable to a standard regional diesel train – but without the noise and the emissions. Coradia iLint stands out for its combination of innovative features: clean energy conversion, flexible energy storage in batteries, smart traction and energy management.

It is now used on the world premiere 100% hydrogen train route, in passenger operation. This regional train only emits steam and condensed water while operating with a low level of noise. The 14 vehicles with fuel cell propulsion belong to Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen (LNVG). LNVG had already started looking for alternatives to diesel trains in 2012 and thus provided momentum for the development of the trains in Germany. Other project partners for this world debut are the Elbe-Weser railways and transport company (evb) and the gas and engineering company Linde.\n“Emission free mobility is one of the most important goals for ensuring a sustainable future and Alstom has a clear ambition to become the world leader in alternative propulsion systems for rail. The world’s first hydrogen train, the Coradia iLint, demonstrates our clear commitment to green mobility combined with state-of-the-art technology. We are very proud to bring this technology into series operation as part of a world premiere, together with our great partners,” says Henri Poupart-Lafarge, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Alstom. \nOn the route between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude, 14 hydrogen-powered Alstom regional trains will be operated by evb on behalf of LNVG, gradually replacing 15 diesel trains. They will be fuelled daily and around the clock at the Linde hydrogen filling station. Thanks to a range of 1,000 kilometres, the Alstom multiple units of the Coradia iLint model, which are emission-free in operation, can run all day long on just one tank of hydrogen on the evb network.

The scope of the project includes the extension of the VLT system by about 700 metres in double track, supply of a terminal station (Terminal Gentileza) with four platforms, in addition to the supply of the APS system for the entire stretch (1.4 kilometres), a rectifier substation and adaptation of an existing one and supply for all the signalling along the stretch. The expansion should allow an increase of approximately 40% in the number of passengers, in addition to opening the way for future expansions of the system in the São Cristóvão region, a traditional neighborhood in the north of Rio de Janeiro. \nWith an intelligent mobility concept, the tram in Rio de Janeiro is powered by APS, a system owned by Alstom that supplies electricity from the ground. It is a system composed of two shoes located at the bottom of the train, and when the vehicle passes through the place where Power Box equipment is installed (about 1,100) the corresponding APS rail segments are energised and the consequent power supply is released to the vehicle. There is also a set of supercapacitors that store and supply energy to the vehicle in places without energising rails or in case of a localised failure, up to the next power point, which eliminates the need for external wires and, consequently, enhances the architecture and city landscape. “The tram allows the city to develop sustainable mobility, in addition to rethinking and modernising urban areas and preserving its architectural heritage,” explains Pierre Bercaire, General Director of Alstom Brasil.',NULL,NULL,1),(862,'Alstom','Alstom’s Chinese joint venture to supply advanced traction system to Nanjing Metro Line 6','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2022/7/alstoms-chinese-joint-venture-supply-advanced-traction-system-nanjing','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2022/07/12/photo%20-%20Copy.jpg?itok=mysv55o3','12 Jul 2022','2023-09-20 16:59:37','32\n                    kms long\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    19\n                    stations\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    11 metro lines\n                    Line 6 will have interchange stations with 11 metro lines in the future',NULL,NULL,1),(863,'Alstom','Alstom’s Chinese joint venture wins Hong Kong International Airport APM operation and maintenance contract','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2022/7/alstoms-chinese-joint-venture-wins-hong-kong-international-airport-apm','','08 Jul 2022','2023-09-20 16:59:40','Press contacts - China\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Li Wang\n      \n              Send an email,This contract shows the customer’s confidence in the Build Operate Maintain (BOM) principle \n\n\nNew generation of reliable and eco-friendly lnnovia APM will help Hong Kong International Airport reinforce its leading role as an international aviation hub\n\n8 July 2022 – Alstom’s Chinese joint venture, CRRC Puzhen Alstom Transportation System Co.

Together with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the TU Berlin, Alstom is developing technical solutions to gradually digitise rail passenger transport in Germany. The project will explore the possibilities of automation in regional transport via the European Train Control System (ETCS). The Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen (LNVG) supports the project and is providing two regional trains for the tests. Automated driving is being tested on routes in Northern Germany. While the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection (BMWK) is supporting the automation research project, Lower Saxony\'s Ministry of Economics is funding the necessary equipment for the two test vehicles with 5.5 million euro.  \nFor the trials, new systems for driverless operation are being developed in a first phase. This includes signal recognition, which will provide the ability to recognise and interpret the railway traffic signals set up along the track. In addition, the train must be able to recognise obstacles. In the event of a malfunction, the train is controlled remotely or guided by the train attendant. Alstom has already demonstrated with test trains in other countries that automated driving and remote control of trains can be technically implemented. The project will determine whether the existing regulatory framework for Automatic Train Operation (ATO) could be adapted. It will then examine which tests and results are needed to sufficiently prove safety standards for automated driving in passenger operation.\nIn a second phase, automated driving must take place as a “living lab” under real conditions. The new systems will be installed in the two LNVG multiple units pre-equipped with ETCS and tested in operation. The findings from development and operation will help to prepare for the later approval of fully automated trains and to further automate regional transport.\nLower Saxony\'s Transport Minister Dr. Bernd Althusmann says: “The future of rail transport is climate-neutral and digital - we know that very well, especially in Lower Saxony. After we have already been using the world\'s first emission-free hydrogen trains here since 2018, we are now testing how we can achieve an even higher quality in local transport through autonomously running trains. The project combines two outstanding qualities of Lower Saxony as a location: innovative mobility and a high level of digitalisation. We are thus creating the basis for more traffic on the railways.”\nMichael Kellner, Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection, explains: “The automation of railways, especially regional transport, offers a variety of opportunities. Falling operating costs make it easier for regional providers to enter the market or expand their services. Routes that have become unprofitable can be automated and operated profitably again. This also reduces commuting by road: less CO2 emissions and a more relaxed journey for commuters.”',NULL,NULL,1),(876,'Alstom','Alstom appoints Toby Tiberghien as Managing Director for East Asia','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2022/6/alstom-appoints-toby-tiberghien-managing-director-east-asia','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2022/05/31/Alstom_Toby_Tiberghien_Headshot.jpg?itok=wmudoLPe','01 Jun 2022','2023-09-20 17:00:53','Press contact - East Asia\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Jane Chan\n      \n              Send an email,1 June 2022 – Alstom has appointed Toby Tiberghien Managing Director for East Asia, within the Asia Pacific region, effective as of today. He replaces Olivier Loison, who is taking over as India’s Managing Director.

There is always a pilot present who can intervene and take control if required, but the basics are handled by the airplane’s onboard computers. Trains are different from planes of course, but it’s a good comparison.  \nAutomatic Train Operation works with an existing system called Automatic Train Protection (ATP).

It’s the truckers, the rail companies, the operators and those retail companies that are at the other end of those supply chains.” While we can’t make ships dock faster or get them unloaded any quicker, automating locomotives could be an essential step in making the supply chains we rely upon faster, more flexible, and more reliable.',NULL,NULL,1),(924,'Alstom','Alstom wins another signalling project in Turkey','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2022/2/alstom-wins-another-signalling-project-turkey','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2022/02/22/Signalling_Project_in_Turkey.jpg?itok=tV5WOq3y','22 Feb 2022','2023-09-20 17:04:39','Press contact - Coralie Collet\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact: Middle East and Turkey\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Bahaa Omran \n      \n              Send an email,Driverless CBTC ensuring a reliable service\n\n\n22 February 2022 – Alstom has signed a new contract to install a complete driverless communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling system and electromechanical infrastructure for the Umraniye-Atasehir-Goztepe (UAG) Metro Line, which is of great importance for the Anatolian side of Istanbul.

This collaboration will accelerate the development of hydrogen trains and reduce the time needed to refuel them.\nThe Alstom and Hynamics teams are already carrying out joint modelling, calculation, and simulation work. This work, which notably mobilises the skills and resources of “EDF Lab”, will then be tested from 2022 on the electrolyser test platform at the ‘EDF Lab Les Renardières’, one of three R&D centres of Électricité de France located in Écuelles (Seine-et-Marne). A hydrogen production station, a compressor up to 450 bars and several storage racks will be mobilised to recreate the filling circuits at real size and to evaluate the behaviour of the equipment under optimal observation conditions.\nUltimately, the aim is to define an international refuelling standard that will make it possible to limit the immobilisation of hydrogen-powered trains during refuelling, which is a major issue for both railway companies and passengers, while complying with the regulations and safety rules in force.\n“This partnership will enable us to optimise the hydrogen distribution infrastructure and the rolling stock made available to operators.

Operating at speeds of up to 200 km/hour, they have clocked up over 380 million miles of service, equivalent to 843 times to the moon and back.  \nDelivering reliable, comfortable services for Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry, Alstom’s Voyager Fleet can be found across the length and breadth of Britain’s Inter-City network from Aberdeen to Penzance, London to Llandudno. With innovations ahead designed to achieve greater sustainability, such as hybrid diesel/battery operation and intelligent engine stop/start, they are set for many more years of service on Britain’s railways.\nPeter Broadley, Managing Director, Services for Alstom UK & Ireland said: “Twenty years of reliable, 200 km/hour operation across Britain is a very significant milestone. We are delighted to celebrate Voyager 20 with our friends from Beacon Rail, CrossCountry and Avanti West Coast and look forward to future innovations to achieve even greater sustainability.”\nRob Dee, Beacon Rail said “The Voyager fleet is an integral part of Beacon’s portfolio, consisting of close to 2,000 items of rolling stock operating in 17 countries across Europe.  Since taking ownership of the Voyagers in 2017 Beacon has worked closely with our customers Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry as well as Alstom to ensure the Voyagers offer a high level of safety, reliability, availability and comfort to the travelling public. Beacon has also commissioned industry colleagues to develop a hybrid battery solution for the fleet. The hybrid will significantly reduce emissions in built-up areas whilst maintaining Voyager’s high-speed, go-anywhere capability”. \nTom Joyner, Managing Director at CrossCountry said: “The Voyager fleet has provided a sterling service for countless passengers over the past twenty years. There are some innovative projects in the pipeline, which will ensure the Voyagers continue to form a key part of our fleet and we are looking forward to working with colleagues from Alstom and Beacon Rail on these in the months ahead.”\nGus Dunster, Executive Director Operations & Safety, Avanti West Coast said: “The Super Voyager has played a key role in the transformation of the West Coast Main Line - being integral to a high frequency timetable and helping to put Shrewsbury and Blackpool back on the map. The recent £8.3m investment in the fleet has given the trains a new lease of life and they will continue to serve our customers with great distinction.”\nIn total 34 Class 220s and 24 Class 221s are in service with CrossCountry operating across multiple mainline routes all serving Birmingham; 20 Class 221’s are in service with Avanti West Coast operating tilting, high speed services along the West Coast Mainline. \nAll 78 units are owned by Beacon Rail, and maintained by Alstom at its Central Rivers depot, with heavy component overhaul taking place at Alstom’s Crewe and Ilford facilities. \nAlstom™ is a protected trademark of the Alstom Group',NULL,NULL,1),(1038,'Alstom','Alstom appoints Michael Keroullé as new President of Alstom Americas','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/7/alstom-appoints-michael-keroulle-new-president-alstom-americas','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2022/04/15/Alstom_KEROULLE_Michael460%20web.jpg?itok=hZ4BoZ_P','22 Jul 2021','2023-09-20 17:13:17','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - USA\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Clifford Cole\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - Canada\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Marilena VARANO\n      \n              Send an email,Brings 24 years of experience in regional & global leadership roles\n22 July 2021 – Alstom announced that it has appointed Michael Keroullé as President of Alstom’s Americas Region, effective July 1st.

Alstom has become the leading international rail actor in this exceptional context. This is a unique responsibility we are ready to endorse and our focus is to offer our solutions wherever they are needed on the planet. We have a clear ambition, the most comprehensive and innovative portfolio, and highly engaged teams across the world.\nBy 2025 we will have outgrown the rail industry significantly and set new industry standards for smart and green mobility in terms of sustainability, innovation, and profitability.”, said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \nAlstom enters in a new chapter of its history on a solid base with an Alstom in Motion strategy launched in 2019 fully on track and following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition, a significantly reinforced profile.  \n***\nThe “Alstom in Motion 2025” builds on well-established strategic pillars\nThis fiscal year 2020/21 closes the second year of the Alstom in Motion strategy (AiM) announced by Alstom on 24 June 2019 which sets a clear ambition: be the leading global innovative player for a sustainable and smart mobility. It also marks the beginning of a new chapter in Alstom history with the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation closed in January 2021. In this context and in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the Group continues to make good progress on the AiM priorities:\n1. Growth by offering greater value to customers\nThe Group expects to outgrow the market significantly with a sales growth over 5% CAGR and expand its global market share by 5 percentage points. This reflects the positive commercial dynamics along with the unique position of Alstom to fully capture market opportunities. \nRegarding market presence, more than 70% share of the Group sales are in North America and Europe, two regions that will benefit from strong stimulus packages. Alstom has in particular a very natural leadership position in Western and Southern Europe. With the Bombardier Transportation acquisition, it also strengthened significantly its industrial and commercial assets in Germany, North America, United Kingdom and Nordics, and plans to further develop in these geographies. \nThe Group is the only industry player which such a presence in emerging markets, with 11 JVs in China, major manufacturing and engineering sites in India. It also demonstrated strong track record in executing complex projects in emerging markets and is uniquely placed to capture growth in Asia, Middle East and Africa stemming from economic growth and urbanization.\nAlstom can also now build on its ability to offer the best value proposition for its customers based on the most complete and a high performing portfolio in the industry, with Rolling Stock ranging from light rail to very high speed train, parts, maintenance and operations services, and a complete portfolio in Signalling.\nSignalling and Services will continue to have the fastest growth potential. Alstom aims to be market leader in Signalling by 2025 benefiting from its technological leadership in ETCS[4], a presence in each strategic market and strong engineering hubs in mature and emerging markets. In Services, Alstom targets to grow at solid mid-single digit, leveraging on the widest installed base of the industry with, 150,000 vehicles, the most extensive depots network and 15,000 highly skilled service employees. In Rolling Stock, Alstom comprehensive and best-in-class portfolio, continuously fuelled with innovation, is positioning the Group ahead of the game, and Alstom will focus most particularly on increasing competitiveness and profitability.\n2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All\nAlstom has significantly reinforced his Research and Development (R&D) resources and intends to expand its leadership in rail innovation. With the new scale and combined expertise, the Group now has more than 9,500 patents and a unique scale and talent base in the industry. R&D investments will be significantly reinforced - expected at €550-600 million per year in 2024/25 at around 3% of annual sales - to further advance innovation in the key areas of smart, green, inclusive and healthier mobility. \nThe Group is the only rail player that today offers the entire scope of green traction solutions and in-house fuel cell technology. Hydrogen trains have been running in Germany since 2018 and the Group has been awarded firm contracts in Germany, France and Italy for 59 trains and has multiplied other partnerships with other countries in Europe. For Smart Mobility, the Group aims to have fully autonomous trains prototypes for freight and passengers ready by 2023. Alstom will also be able to leverage data from the 35,000 vehicles currently maintained and can count on its 7,500 software engineers and systems architects working on digital mobility solutions to further advance its offering to enable fully connected metros, trams as well regional trains. \n3. Efficiency at scale, Powered by Digital \nThe continued transformation and efficiency gains combined with the successful integration of Bombardier Transportation will be a key focus to deliver on the Group’s ambitious profitable growth targets. The Group will continue to deploy its proven ability in operational excellence and project management, leverage its balanced global footprint, drive the digitalization of its value chain to optimise sites and projects and transfer its expertise throughout the new organisation. \nThis will be achieved on a basis of clear strategic initiatives supported by a set of dedicated targets by 2025:\nThe Group will drive the transformation by deploying its digital suite to reach 100% Group wide, leverage its scale to invest and accelerate and increase digitalization of its processes by 20%.\nThe Group will drive continued project management excellence in order to achieve a Net Promoter Score of 8.3, implement systematic cash focus in projects, and extend best practices to lower hard inventories by 20%. \nThe Group will grow its sites in Best Costs Countries, leverage its combined locations to optimize its industrial strategy and optimize its supply chain to increase global manufacturing work by 20% in Best Costs Countries and increase manufacturing productivity by 10%.\n4. One Alstom Team Agile, Inclusive and Responsible \nThe Group reiterates its Corporate Social Responsibility convictions to aim for carbon neutrality in transport and increase social equity and inclusion by increasing the availability and efficiency of public transport. These convictions are driven by one Alstom team with one set of values: Agile, Inclusive and Responsible.\nThe Group extended its ESG 2025 targets and will bring this to the scope of the new organisation. Its priorities are: Enabling decarbonisation of mobility, Caring for our people, Creating a positive impact on society and Acting as a responsible business partner. \n\nEnabling\n			decarbonisation of mobility\n\n\n\n25% energy reduction in solutions[5] \n\n\n100% of newly developed solutions eco-designed\n\n\n100% electricity supply from renewables \n\n\nAlstom committed to science-based CO2 emissions reduction targets within the frame of the Paris Agreement[6]\n\n\n\nCreating\n			a positive impact on society\n\n\n\n250,000 beneficiaries per year from local actions and Alstom foundation\n\n\n\nCaring\n			for our people\n\n\n\nTotal recordable injury rate at 2\n\n\n28% Women in management, engineering & professional role\n\n\nGlobal Top Employer certification\n\n\n\nActing\n			as a responsible business partner\n\n\n\n100% of suppliers monitored or assessed on Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethics and Compliance standards according to their level of risk\n\n\nMost recently, Alstom has signed in June 2021 a €400 million Green guarantee facility with BBVA for the issuance of bank guarantees in support of Alstom’s commercial contracts which recognizes the Group contribution to Sustainable Development Goals SDG 9 “Industry, innovation and infrastructure” and SDG 11 “Sustainable Cities and Communities.\n***\nIntegration of Bombardier Transportation \nThe integration of Bombardier Transportation is on track and has received strong employee support and customer endorsements. Five months after closing, the organisation is deployed as per target; the product and process convergence roadmaps are secured, and the organisation is now operating under one unified IT system. The Group also achieved its first significant commercial wins from the combined strength of the portfolio and expanded geographical footprint resulting in around €6 billion of orders in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.\nA clear integration roadmap and timeline has been set to complement the Group’s strategy: \nStabilisation of challenging Bombardier Transportation legacy projects based on Alstom’s proven expertise and execution track record in 2 to 3 years with a strong focus on 2021/22;\nOne operating model with best-in-class converged processes and product portfolio in 3 years;\nFull leverage of the significant geographical, industrial and product scale and complementarities for synergies, enhanced value proposition and growth from 4-5 years onwards.\n***\nProject stabilisation impacting fiscal year 2021/22 Free Cash Flow\nThe current fiscal year 2021/22 will be a transition year, focused on the stabilization of the Bombardier Transportation challenging legacy projects. During H1 2021/22 free cash flow is expected to be between (€1.6 billion) and (€1.9 billion) impacted by working capital consumption due to phasing, industrial ramp-up and project stabilization efforts. In H2 2021/22, the Group expects positive free cash flow driven by increased deliveries and operations stabilization. Overall, this should result in significant negative free cash flow in 2021/22.\nThereafter, the Group expects to see yearly positive free cash flow generation towards its mid-term target[7], driven by progressive working capital stabilization.\n***\nMid-term financial trajectory and objectives \nSales: Between 2020/21 (proforma sales of €14 billion) – and 2024/25, Alstom is aiming at sales Compound Annual Growth Rate over 5%, supported by strong market momentum and unparalleled €74.5 billion backlog securing ca. €30 billion of sales over the next three years. Rolling stock should grow above market rate, Services at solid mid-single digit path and Signalling at high single digit path\nProfitability: The adjusted EBIT margin should reach between 8% and 10% from 2024/25 onwards, benefiting from operational excellence initiatives, the completion of the challenging projects in backlog while synergies are expected to deliver €400m run rate between 2024/25 and 2025/26;\nFree Cash Flow: From 2024/25 onwards, the conversion from net income[8] to free cash flow should be over 80%[9] driven by mid-term stability of working capital, stabilisation of CAPEX to around 2% of sales and cash focus initiatives while benefiting from volume and synergies take up;\nAlstom will maintain its disciplined capital allocation focusing on maintaining its investment grade profile while keeping flexibility and ability to pursue growth opportunities through focused bolt-on M&A. \nAlstom is committed to delivering sustained shareholder returns with a dividend pay-out ratio of between 25% and 35%[10]. For fiscal year 2020/2021, on the dividend announced on May 11[11], Alstom’s board of directors decided to propose, in its meeting of July 4, to the General Shareholder Assembly a dividend in share or in cash, which will be detailed in the notice for the shareholders’ meeting.\nNote to investors and editors:  The presentations of the Capital Markets day will be available online at 8.45 am Paris time and a replay of the meeting will be available during the day at Capital Markets Day 06/07/2021 | Alstom.\nOrders & Sales of first Quarter of Fiscal year 2021/22 will be released on 20 July 2021.\nAlstom is a trademark of the Alstom Group \n***\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements which are based on current plans and forecasts of Alstom’s management.

Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.\nOrder backlog\nOrder backlog represents sales not yet recognised from orders already received. Order backlog at the end of a financial year is computed as follows:\norder backlog at the beginning of the year;\nplus new orders received during the year;\nless cancellations of orders recorded during the year;\nless sales recognised during the year.\nThe order backlog is also subject to changes in the scope of consolidation, contract price adjustments and foreign currency translation effects.\nOrder backlog corresponds to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, as per IFRS 15 quantitative and qualitative disclosures requirement.\nBook-to-Bill \nThe book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period. \nAdjusted EBIT\nAdjusted EBIT (“aEBIT”) is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors. \nStarting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). \nThis mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Bombardier Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd., Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd. and Changchun Bombardier Railway Vehicles Company Ltd. \naEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements: \nnet restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs);\ntangibles and intangibles impairment;\ncapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;\nany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business;\nand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments.\nA non-recurring item is a “one-off” exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.\nAdjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT in percentage of sales.\nAdjusted net profit\nFollowing the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from these Fiscal year 2020/21 consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the “adjusted net profit” indicator aimed at restating its net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude  the impact of  amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocations (“PPA”) in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.\nFree cash flow \nFree Cash Flow is deﬁned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.\nThe most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities. \nAlstom uses the Free Cash Flow both for internal analysis purposes as well as for external communication as the Group believes it provides accurate insight into the actual amount of cash generated or used by operations.\nPay-out ratio\nThe payout ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the “Adjusted net profit” as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.\n[1] Over a period between March 2021 and March 2025\n[2] adjusted net profit” - see definition in appendix\n[3] During H1 2021/22, free cash flow is expected to reach between (€1.6 billion) and (€1.9 billion) impacted by working capital consumption due to phasing, industrial ramp-up and projects stabilization efforts. In H2 2021/22, the Group expects positive free cash flow driven by increased deliveries and operations stabilization.

Part of a landmark framework agreement with Danish State Railways (DSB) valued at a total of €2.6 billion, the first firm order of 100 Coradia Stream regional trains as well as a 15-year full-service maintenance agreement amounts to a value of €1.4 billion. The framework agreement includes an additional 15 years of maintenance services and the possibility to order additional trainsets.\nDelivery of DSB’s “Fremtidens Tog – Nye Tog” (Trains of the Future – New Trains) is scheduled to begin in the last quarter of 2024. Once in service, this new fleet will operate as a regional and fast rail service and connect Denmark’s Frederikshavn region in the north to Rødby in the southeast after passing through the capital city of Copenhagen. \n“We are of course extremely pleased that DSB has selected Alstom to build their ‘Trains of the Future’. This further cements Alstom’s position as the reliable, world-leading train manufacturer of choice. At the same time, we already have a number of long-term maintenance agreements around Europe, which means that we come with a robust services set-up that supports the fleet’s reliability,” said Rob Whyte, Managing Director of Alstom Nordics.\nThe Coradia Stream for DSB has been specially adapted to meet the needs of the Danish rail network and its top speed of 200 km/h will help ensure swift mobility across the country. Each trainset will consist of five single- deck coaches with a total seating capacity for 300 passengers. The trains will be pre-fitted with Alstom’s Atlas onboard ETCS Baseline 3[1], as well as an STM[2] interface enabling it to operate on Denmark’s legacy signalling system.',NULL,NULL,1),(1068,'Alstom','Alstom’s Chinese joint venture wins its first airport APM operation and maintenance contract in China','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/6/alstoms-chinese-joint-venture-wins-its-first-airport-apm-operation-and','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/06/10/IMG_4581.JPG?itok=RUh-NgCP','10 Jun 2021','2023-09-20 17:15:51','Jianwei Zhang,“This agreement is a new milestone for Alstom’s APM operation and maintenance services in China.”\n      \n                  \n                  \n                    \n            Jianwei Zhang\n      \n                                          \n            President of Alstom China',NULL,NULL,1),(1069,'Alstom','Alstom-Bombardier led consortium to supply Tren Maya railway project','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/6/alstom-bombardier-led-consortium-supply-tren-maya-railway-project','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/06/08/SLEEPER_EXTER_15%20Logo%20%26%20Copyright.png?itok=hMZ_khpF','09 Jun 2021','2023-09-20 17:15:54','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - Latin America\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Ana Caiasso\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,9 June 2021 – The consortium made up of Alstom Transport Mexico, Bombardier Transportation México, Gami Ingeniería e Instalaciones and Construcciones Urales Procesos Industriales, will supply Mexico’s Tren Maya, a large-scale intercity railway project that is set to transform sustainable mobility in the country. The total value of the contract comes to approximately €1.3 billion (over Mex$31 billion). The portion for Alstom-Bombardier amounts to nearly €1 billion.\nThe winning bid was announced on May 26th by the National Fund for the Promotion of Tourism (Fonatur), after its technical committee endorsed the consortium’s operational, technical, and economic proposals. The factors that determined Fonatur\'s decision to select the winning consortium were cost, degree of national integration, delivery times and design proposals. \n“We are extremely proud to have been selected to supply the Tren Maya – a train for Mexico, built in Mexico – as well as its full signalling system. The design of the three types of trains - Xiinbal, Janal and P\'atal - is exclusive to Mexico and inspired by the Mayan culture, where the majestic jaguar’s lines, speed and beauty were inspirational elements for the train. The manufacturing of the Tren Maya will begin immediately, with Mexican labour, after the signing of the contract,” said Maite Ramos, General Director of Alstom México.\nThe consortium led by Alstom-Bombardier will be responsible for the design, manufacture and commissioning of 42 X’trapolis trains, as well as the full signalling system including the design, supply and installation of the ETCS[1] onboard technology and over 1,500 km of trackside equipment including ETCS, interlocking, traffic management and telecommunications systems, leveraging the complete Alstom portfolio. Moreover, the consortium is responsible for the construction of the maintenance workshops and garages and the after-sales service of the system’s equipment.\nAlstom’s new X’trapolis model for Tren Maya will leverage the group’s manufacturing and engineering potential to produce a train that is up-to-date, competitive and reliable in the long term, based on trains which have already proven their merits. The X’trapolis train is a robust platform with a modular interior - all configurations are possible from the same lightweight bodyshell. 5500 X’trapolis cars have been ordered so far in the world. This train will also use components and expertise contributed by the former Bombardier, the most outstanding being its lightweight Flexx Eco bogie, designed for a maximum speed of 176 km/h. More than 8,300 units of the same bogie model have been ordered or delivered to date in countries including Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and most notably in the United Kingdom.\nThe consortium will offer the X’trapolis in three distinct configurations: the first in a flexible and comfortable standard service set-up (Xiinbal); the second prioritising restaurant cars (Janal); and the last in long-distance sleeper configuration (P’atal). All versions offer passengers ample legroom at their seats and plenty of space to move around. Passengers will have more than enough room to store their luggage, with overhead racks borrowed from Alstom’s intercity train Coradia, and vertical racks in each car. Since the floor is flat throughout, passengers with reduced mobility will have full liberty of movement. In the X’trapolis, passengers will benefit from high-performance HVAC and wide windows onto the breath-taking scenery of the Maya region.\nAlstom is a major supplier of onboard and trackside ETCS equipment, representing 70% of the world’s onboard rail systems in service and 18,000 kilometres of track worldwide and bringing significant advantages in terms of maintenance cost savings, safety, reliability, punctuality and traffic capacity.\nTren Maya is a comprehensive 1,525-kilometre mobility project that aims to develop and connect the southeast of the country with the Yucatán Peninsula, and will be a great boost to mobility and economic growth in this region of Mexico. Overall, the project will generate 4,500 direct and 7,500 indirect jobs, which will generate significant economic development for the community. Alstom will manufacture the 42 trains at its Ciudad Sahagún Hidalgo plant.\nAlstom is a trademark of the ALSTOM Group\nAlstom™ and X’trapolis™ are protected trademarks of the Alstom Group\n[1] European Train Control System',NULL,NULL,1),(1070,'Alstom','Alstom brings train manufacturing back to life in Western Australia','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/6/alstom-brings-train-manufacturing-back-life-western-australia','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/12/09/exterior_cam_02_daytime_edit.jpg?itok=Ce1hjaeU','07 Jun 2021','2023-09-20 17:15:59','Press contacts - Australia\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Sheldon Young\n      \n              Send an email,Local production starts at METRONET’s brand new facility in Perth\n7 June 2021 – Alstom will today commence operations at METRONET’s brand-new train manufacturing facility in Perth, Western Australia (WA).

The new facilities, located in the heart of the factory, has a component scanner, ten FDM[1] industrial wire machines, and three SLA-DLP[2] resin devices, which allow printing tools for industrial centers and prototypes to validate designs, moulds, and serial parts. \nFrom April 2020 to March 2021, the Hub has designed and printed more than 258 different types of parts, with a total of 13,978 pieces manufactured, resulting in significant time savings equivalent to weeks of work. \"This new enlarged Hub will allow us to increase the number of components generated by 3D printing, including structural, functional, and safety elements; incorporating new materials and techniques that improve Alstom\'s manufacturing processes,\" says Jaume Altesa, head of the Hub and one of the group\'s leading 3D printing experts worldwide.\nOne of the keys to success in incorporating printed parts into the manufacturing process is based on the Barcelona team\'s specialization in plastics approved for use in rolling stock, highly resistant to fire and smoke. This expertise allows them to carry out the entire workflow from the center, including post-processing and reverse engineering tasks and providing support to the rest of its centers. The Hub has participated in many key projects at Group level, such as the TGV 2020 (Alstom\'s latest generation of very high-speed trains), in collaboration with the La Rochelle factory, for the analysis and redesign of train components. \nCreated in 2016, as part of Alstom\'s \"Industry of the Future\" program, the 3D printing center at the Santa Perpètua Industrial Center was the pioneer in incorporating this type of technique at Alstom, and is now a world reference within the group, both in R&D processes and in the production of components. The center is currently immersed in several innovation projects focused on metal 3D printing and joint initiatives with other company centers and in collaboration projects with the regional ecosystem of companies dedicated to 3D printing in Catalonia. \n[1] FDM : Fused deposition modeling\n[2] SLA:  Stereolithography - DLP: digital light processing',NULL,NULL,1),(1077,'Alstom','Alstom Vado Ligure delivers the 10th Traxx DC3 locomotive to RAILPOOL GmbH branch in Italy','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/5/alstom-vado-ligure-delivers-10th-traxx-dc3-locomotive-railpool-gmbh','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/06/01/cutting%20of%20the%20ribbon.jpg?itok=LvVhvTPc','31 May 2021','2023-09-20 17:16:38','31 May 2021 - Alstom has delivered the 10th Traxx DC3 locomotive to its customer RAILPOOL, one of the leading railway vehicle leasing company in Europe, operating in 16 European countries with more than 400 locomotives.

One of the most interesting features is the possibility of equipping the locomotive with the \'Last Mile\' function, allowing new operating concepts, where the locomotive can be operated on non-electrified lines, often found in ports, industrial areas or terminals. The \"Last Mile\" equipment is optional and can be installed on the locomotive even after delivery as a post-delivery upgrade. RAILPOOL has decided to install it on the entire fleet operating on the Italian network, ensuring the maximum and full flexibility of usage of the locomotives.\nThe Traxx DC3 is part of the Traxx DC3 platform, developed to pull trains throughout Europe, and available in different configurations to enable interoperability in many countries.\nDeeply rooted in the Italian railway tradition, Alstom has been manufacturing trains for 160 years and signalling and electrification solution for 90 years. Today, with 10 sites throughout Italy and more than 3,500 employees, Alstom is a strong local employer recognised as one of the leaders on the Italian market and has several centres of excellence: one in high-speed Avelia Pendolino trains, Coradia Stream single-deck regional trains, E464 and Traxx locomotives, and another in railway signalling equipment and systems. \nThe Vado Ligure Alstom Plant has over a hundred years of tradition in the design and construction of locomotives, including the latest generations of Traxx and is a centre for the production and maintenance of rolling stock, locomotives and subsystems.',NULL,NULL,1),(1078,'Alstom','Alstom is first in the Netherlands to obtain ISO 55001 certification for railway security','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/5/alstom-first-netherlands-obtain-iso-55001-certification-railway-security','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/06/02/Hanzelijn-00272_mr.jpg?itok=k24pPY53','31 May 2021','2023-09-20 17:16:43','',NULL,NULL,1),(1079,'Alstom','Alstom to supply 32 Coradia Continental regional trains to Hessische Landesbahn','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/5/alstom-supply-32-coradia-continental-regional-trains-hessische','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/05/26/Coradia%20Continental%20mit%20RMV-Band.jpg?itok=cDcxl3E8','27 May 2021','2023-09-20 17:16:48','',NULL,NULL,1),(1080,'Alstom','SNCF Voyageurs & Alstom launch TGV M \"power car\"','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/5/sncf-voyageurs-alstom-launch-tgv-m-power-car','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/05/26/Motrice%20Alstom%20Belfort-3.jpeg?itok=dt4VQmfO','26 May 2021','2023-09-20 17:16:54','Press contact - Corporate France & DACH region\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Philippe Molitor\n      \n              Send an email,Following the presentation of a TGV M body shell on 16 July 2020, Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud (President of Alstom France), Christophe Fanichet (Chairman and CEO, SNCF Voyageurs), and Alain Krakovitch (Managing Director, Voyages SNCF) are today unveiling the first TGV M power car in Alstom\'s Belfort workshops.\nA new face for a new train\nThis eco-designed TGV, the first trainsets of which are scheduled to enter service in 2024, has benefited from the know-how of the best experts from Voyages SNCF and Alstom, brought together on a common platform during the definition and co-specification phases of the project.

Various sensors, cameras, radars and lidars (laser detection) were fitted to collect essential data for the project.\nInitial trials on commercial tracks, followed by a phase of tests at the railway test centre\nThe first trials took place over one week, in the beginning of March, between Aulnoye and Busigny and between Busigny and Calais (in the North of France). The Regio 2N regional train prototype ran on a commercial track, with the project\'s engineers and technicians on board.\nThe trials included tests of:\n\nThe perception and recognition systems for the signals located along the track;\nThe geolocation system, particularly by satellite, which provides the precise position of the train.\n\nDuring this first phase of trials, the sensors and equipment of these new systems specially fitted on the train were activated for the purpose of observing how they work but did not interfere with the movement of the train. \nThe Regio 2N regional train prototype was driven by an SNCF driver specialised in operating under test conditions. \nAt the end of this week of trials, tests were conducted at the CEF railway test centre in Petite-Forêt, near Valenciennes, to test the train\'s autonomous operation system, which makes it possible to automate the acceleration and braking of the train.\nA second trial phase underway to achieve semi-autonomy\nFrom 17 to 21 May, following the tests carried out at the CEF railway test centre, a second series of trials has been scheduled to fine-tune the operating system of the train prototype. \nThese new trials are taking place on the national railway network at Busigny (in the North of France) and will lead, in the coming months, to semi-autonomous operation in the trial phase.\nSemi-autonomous operation makes it possible to automate the acceleration and braking of the train, supervised by a driver.\nThese trials are a key step towards achieving the consortium\'s ultimate objective: achieving full autonomy by 2023. \nThe trials, authorised by the French National Railway Safety Authority (EPSF), will help to substantiate the safety demonstration required for the train\'s future authorisation to operate.\nAs an observer in the project, EPSF will be in a position to assess the understanding of the technologies developed and their impact on the railway system, as well as any possible regulatory changes needing to be made for this new type of operation.\nCybersecurity issues, which are crucial for the autonomous train, have been taken into consideration from the start of the project. The project partners are working closely with ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d\'Information), the French national cybersecurity authority. \nTrain prototype to alternate between commercial service and trials over the next two years\nThis Regio 2N regional train will be used over the next two years as a prototype of the autonomous passenger train. \nThe train will be tested on the track between Aulnoye and Busigny, during the school holidays.\nOutside the research and test periods, the Regio 2N regional train, an activity of SNCF Voyageurs, will be in regular commercial service, transporting passengers. During these commercial trips, in conventional driving mode, it will record data that will improve the performance of the signal recognition algorithms by detecting, for example, the colour of the traffic lights and the surrounding environment of the train.\nAt the same time, laboratory work is being carried out on trial simulators at the sites of all the consortium partners to fine-tune the itineraries of the test train and further develop the automated system. \nAutonomous train: real benefits for transporting passengers and goods\nTrain automation means real benefits for rail customers:\n\nIncreased capacity, because running more trains means being able to transport more passengers and more goods;\nGreater fluidity and regularity thanks to harmonised traffic flow and optimised speed, making it easier to react to unforeseen circumstances;\nMore environmental-friendly transport, thanks to reduced energy consumption and the shift from road to rail.\n\nAutonomy thus provides rail transport with new perspectives: more flexible organisation, with the possibility of rapidly changing the number of trains in line with changing needs. These benefits will encourage a modal shift from road to rail, thereby contributing to a more environmental-friendly mode of transport.\n\"Our project has just passed a significant milestone with great success. Another step has been taken towards achieving autonomy in rail. The mobilisation of the SNCF teams and of our partners allows us to explore all the issues, both human and technological. With our research work and trials, we are making progress in the rail sector and preparing for its future development.\" Pierre Izard, Director of Technology, Innovation and Group Projects, SNCF Group\n\"The trials conducted over the last few months represent a significant step towards our goal, that of inventing the transport of the future with the autonomous train.

As many as 91 carriages of the new MF19 trains, designed and manufactured by Alstom at its Valenciennes and Crespin sites, will be equipped with Alstom’s interchangeable CBTC (I-CBTC) solution, developed for RATP. \nThe confirmed part of the contract covers adaptation of the I-CBTC solution and its rollout on lines 10, 7bis and 3bis (44 trains). RATP may award conditional phases, such as rollout on line 3 (47 trains), maintenance in working condition for 15 years, or functional upgrades. \nThe rollout of the I-CBTC on-board automatic train operation system is part of the OCTYS program to upgrade the automatic operation system on Paris metro system. Thanks to the scalability and upgradability provided by OCTYS’ interchangeability concept, the CBTC solution can be rolled out in several phases whilst guaranteeing its uniformity across the whole network. Lines 10, 7bis and 3bis will initially operate with reduced ground infrastructure and no radio communication. On line 3, interchangeability will enable the new MF19 trains fitted with Alstom’s I-CBTC solution to run on existing ground infrastructure.\n“It is a great honour for us once again to work on modernising the Paris metro system. Our I-CBTC solution is already in operation across 34km on lines 5 and 9, and over 80 million kilometres have already been covered since it entered into service. It is also being rolled out on lines 6 and 11 of the Paris metro. This new contract is a mark of RATP’s trust in our French expertise in urban signalling and of our commitment to close cooperation over the next thirty years. It reinforces Alstom’s signalling activity in France, where it is the largest employer in this particular sector with over 1,700 employees,” said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President, Alstom France.\nI-CBTC is an interchangeable “Communication-Based Train Control” (CBTC) type automation system that meets the criteria of RATP for the OCTYS standard. Developed in partnership with RATP, I-CBTC is capable of carrying out remote operating functions, monitoring safety in operations and controlling traction and braking systems to run the metros automatically, with different levels of automation, according to the configuration chosen by RATP. It improves frequency on the line. Close to 130 Paris metro carriages (MF01) operating on lines 5 and 9 are now equipped with Alstom’s I-CBTC on-board solution. The MP14 and MP89 trains due to enter circulation on lines 11 and 6 respectively will also be fitted with the Alstom solution. These two lines are also equipped an Alstom radio system to transmit data between the train and the ground, which is part of the I-CTBC solution.\nAlstom will be responsible for the development, validation, industrialisation, installation, testing and commissioning of its on-board I-CBTC solution.\nThree of Alstom’s French sites will be involved in this project:\n\nAix-en-Provence will develop, supply and ensure the overall engineering of the system;\nSaint-Ouen will be responsible for rollout assistance, cybersecurity, installation, testing, commissioning, and maintaining in working condition;\nVilleurbanne will supply some electronic equipment and ensure reliability and maintainability (RAM).\n\nAlstom has rolled out its CBTC automatic train operation systems on 109 metro lines in 23 countries, with 28 of those lines fully automated. This represents a total of over 1,500km of metro lines in operation.

Measuring 45 metres, the T9 line Citadis X05 can transport up to 314 passengers. Starting this year, 80,000 passengers are expected on the line, which serves the 13th arrondissement of Paris and the towns of Ivry-sur-Seine, Vitry-sur-Seine, Thiais, Choisy-le-Roi, and Orly-Ville. \nIn November 2016, Île-de-France Mobilités, which is financing 100% of the rolling stock, chose Alstom to provide 22 Citadis X05 tramways, which feature a particularly innovative design, thanks to its new light signature which was chosen from three variants proposed by Île-de-France Mobilités during a public consultation in February 2017. These tramways were developed and built at Alstom’s La Rochelle site, a worldwide centre of excellence for Alstom tramways. Tramway deliveries began in November 2019 and ended in December 2020, in accordance with the initial timeframe that had been agreed with prime contractor representative Transamo.\n“Alstom and its teams are proud to see that Citadis tramways are now operational on the T9 line, a much-anticipated route for Val-de-Marne residents. With their particularly innovative design, we have full confidence in the capacity for these new tramways to meet the high expectations for comfort and reliability of Parisians and Île-de-France residents,” insisted Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Alstom France President.\nThe new tramway’s design, fruit of a partnership between Alstom’s Design & Styling teams and design agency Saguez & Partners[2], revolves around a light signature that runs throughout the entire tramway, both outside and inside, and provides better views of doors opening and closing. This includes a red line of light when the doors close, a green one when they open and a continuous white one when the tramway is in motion.\nThe tramway features 8 double-doors per side, in addition to wider, well-lit gangways to improve flow and increase the passenger exchange rate[3] by 20%. Tramways have been optimised through glass surfaces amounting to 45%, with 100% LED lighting, 8 extra-wide multimedia screens for visual display maps, USB ports, and bench seating. These innovations provide a high level of comfort along with an enriched passenger experience. \nThe tramway is also energy-efficient, thanks to improved energy usage from its traction and auxiliaries (100% LED lighting and air conditioning respectively provide -25% and -15% energy usage). The overall cost of preventive maintenance has dropped by 18%. Materials are 99% recoverable. \nEight out of Alstom’s eighteen French sites are contributing to manufacturing these tramways: La Rochelle for development and assembly, Ornans for motors, Le Creusot for bogies, Tarbes for modules and equipment, Valenciennes for the interior and service activities, Villeurbanne for onboard electronics, Aix-en-Provence for tachometer generators, and Saint-Ouen for design. \n13 additional tramways have been ordered by Île-de-France Mobilités for the number 10 Tram line, which will connect Clamart to Anthony. They are currently in the development stage. \n[1] “lumière” is a French word for light, in the sense of a source of illumination\n[2] http://saguez-and-partners.com/ \n[3] Exchange rate: ratio that measures total passenger door openings and the total passenger area length for one side of a tramway.',NULL,NULL,1),(1099,'Alstom','First order of hydrogen trains in France – a historic step towards sustainable mobility','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/4/first-order-hydrogen-trains-france-historic-step-towards-sustainable','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/04/07/Alstom_Coradia%20Polyvalent%20Regiolis_Hydrogene_2018.jpg?itok=Ce93_wmn','08 Apr 2021','2023-09-20 17:18:34','Press contact - Coralie Collet\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Grand Est and Occitanie regions sign the very first order of dual mode electric-hydrogen trains in France. This marks a historic step in rail transport’s reduction in CO2 emissions for the benefit of passengers and regions, and in the development of a hydrogen ecosystem as well as a promising sector for the future.\nActing on behalf of the four regions, SNCF Voyageurs has placed an order with Alstom for the first 12 dual mode electric-hydrogen trains (plus two optional trainsets) in the Coradia Polyvalent range for Régiolis, developed by Alstom. The contract is worth a total of almost 190 million euros[1]. In the early days, trains were powered by steam and thermal, then electric energy followed, this innovation marks a genuine revolution in rail mobility. A first in France, it will work towards the energy transition goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution, an ambition supported by the French government through its Hydrogen plan launched in June 2018. It is fully in line with the PLANETER programme to reduce the environmental impact of SNCF Voyageurs’ regional mobility solutions, based on the conviction that introducing more TERs (regional express trains) can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Other French regions have already expressed their interest in participating in a second phase of the project.\nThis official French order for hydrogen-powered trains is the result of two years of joint efforts by the project’s various stakeholders. The dual mode electric-hydrogen Coradia Polyvalent train meets the requirements of France’s diverse rail network and has an autonomy of up to 600 km on sections of non-electrified railway. This four-car, 72m-long train has a total capacity of 218 seats and the same dynamic performance and level of comfort as the dual mode electric-diesel version. \nAlmost 400 dual mode electric-thermal and full-electric Coradia Polyvalent trains have been ordered by French regions since 2011. The development and manufacture of Coradia Polyvalent trains secure over 2,000 jobs in France for Alstom and its suppliers. Six of Alstom’s 15 sites in France are involved in the project: Reichshoffen (Bas-Rhin) for design and assembly, Ornans (Doubs) for engines, Le Creusot (Saône-et-Loire) for bogies, Tarbes (Hautes-Pyrénées) for traction chains and the development of hydrogen propulsion, Villeurbanne (Rhône) for on-board electronics and Saint-Ouen (Seine-Saint-Denis) for design.\n“France has everything it needs to become a hydrogen champion: the French government is fully committed to turning this ambition into reality. We will be covering 47 million euros of development costs for France’s first regional hydrogen-powered train. I am delighted that this support has enabled the four partner regions to confirm their order for the first 14 trains,” said Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, Minister Delegate for Transport, French Ministry of the Ecological Transition.\n“Environmental protection is a major issue and without doubt the greatest challenge of the 21st century. This order for the first Coradia trains in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is the next step in our region’s ambition to boost green growth focusing on innovation, business development and job creation. Since our commitment to the European project Zero Emission Valley, we have aimed to make our region – home to almost all players in the hydrogen sector – one of the lowest carbon regions in Europe, by developing applications for this new source of energy. Hydrogen trains are an innovative alternative to the diesel trains running on our non-electrified lines,” said Laurent Wauquiez, President of the regional council of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.\n“As a source of energy and a storage solution, hydrogen, and particularly green hydrogen, is a way not only to tackle the effects of global warming, but also to boost employment, attractiveness and growth in our region. As a pioneer in this strategic technology, the region has brought together the talents and skills of both Bourgogne and Franche-Comté in its shift towards hydrogen. The order for three Coradia Polyvalent H2s worth a total of 52 million euros marks another step in our rollout of hydrogen for low-carbon mobility solutions. The trains will run between Auxerre and Laroche-Migennes, and will be part of the first regional ecosystem in France to include the train, based in Auxerre,” said Marie-Guite Dufay, President of the regional council of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.\n“This landmark order confirms our commitment to maintaining employment and activity at the Reichshoffen site, where all the trains – three plus two optional for the Grand Est region and nine others ordered by our counterparts – will be assembled. This is the first step in the long-term strategy of TER Grand Est and our involvement in this unprecedented programme aims to stimulate a nationwide launch of the light hydrogen train in France. Indeed, the trials carried out will be fundamental in developing a French hydrogen rail sector and, in a second phase, producing the light hydrogen train that the Grand Est region badly needs to roll out its policy to save and develop its small railways,” said the President of the regional council of Grand Est.\n“This is a key moment in our drive for hydrogen in Occitanie. This first order gives the go-ahead for a new era of technological progress at the service of green mobility with the liO regional public transport service. The Occitanie Region is the only one committed to the 4 greening solutions for its regional trains (Régiolis Hybrid, battery train, bioGNV, hydrogen) and will welcome the 3 hydrogen Régiolis trains on the Montréjeau - Luchon line which we are going to reopen by 2025. It is also good news for our region’s employment and growth, particularly with the Alstom plant in Tarbes involved in manufacturing these innovative trains. Low-carbon reindustrialisation of our regions and green mobility solutions are no longer a utopian dream, they are already at work in our regions. I would like to salute the collective engagement of the four regions that have demonstrated their capacity to initiate and support this project, which promotes the emergence of a promising sector for the future here in France,” said Carole Delga, President of the regional council of Occitanie / Pyrénées – Méditerranée.\n“Alstom is particularly proud to be contributing, alongside SNCF Voyageurs and the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Grand Est and Occitanie regions, to a cleaner and more sustainable mobility solution. Alstom is the first rail company in the world to launch a hydrogen train onto the market and to master this technology through its iLint train, developed for the German market. This new order for the French market is fully in line with Alstom Group’s ambition to become number one in the green and smart mobility market and to help roll out an efficient hydrogen ecosystem in our regions,” said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom France.\n“This order marks a historic and concrete step towards clean mobility, by rolling out a new rail solution with zero direct emissions. Hydrogen has become a concrete solution to help regions achieve their energy transition. We are proud of our commitment to this way forward and of the addition of this technology to the range of solutions developed for our regions through our PLANETER programme. This order is the result of several years of work alongside our organising authorities and the manufacturer, achieved through the commitment and expertise of our teams in the Rolling Stock and TER departments, to develop a hydrogen train to meet our regions’ needs,” said Christophe Fanichet, CEO, SNCF Voyageurs.\n[1] This contract was booked in the 4th quarter of Alstom’s 2020/21 fiscal year',NULL,NULL,1),(1100,'Alstom','Alstom secures five-year service contract extension for automated people mover system at Dubai International (DXB)','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/4/alstom-secures-five-year-service-contract-extension-automated-people-mover-system-dubai-international-dxb','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/04/06/5_car_train_new_-1%5B1%5D.jpg?itok=iDZ6NrsA','06 Apr 2021','2023-09-20 17:18:39','Press contact: Middle East and Turkey\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Bahaa Omran \n      \n              Send an email,6 April 2021 - Alstom has signed a five-year extension to its contract with Dubai Airports to provide comprehensive operations and maintenance (O&M) services for the InnoviaTM APM 300 automated people mover (APM) system at Dubai International (DXB). \nAlstom’s APM system at Dubai International Airport has consistently been a top performer.

This is part of a project implemented by TRAINOSE - the main rail transport provider in Greece - in which Alstom is to provide depot modernisation and corrective maintenance for the five trains that will constitute the country’s first fleet of high-speed trains. The two contracts, signed in March 2020 for depot modernisation and in June 2020 for maintenance, are worth a total of approximately €40 million.\nThe scope of the contracts includes modernisation of a depot in Thessaloniki and corrective maintenance services for five Alstom ETR470 Pendolino high-speed trains. The Thessaloniki depot has undergone significant modernisation works in the past few months. The trains have also been fully refurbished and modernised by Alstom at its Savigliano site in Italy. Following an extensive upgrade process, the trains, now belonging to TRAINOSE as a part of the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Group (FSI), will have improved features such as Wi-Fi connection and new passenger information systems. The trains have also been upgraded with ETCS signalling and modified to operate under 25 kV catenary so as to be fully suitable for operation on the Greek network. The first Pendolino train will start circulating between Athens and Thessaloniki from March 2021. The other four trains are expected to be delivered to Thessaloniki by Autumn 2021.\n“Introducing high-speed trains to Greece is a major achievement for Alstom and for our client in the country’s railway transport modernisation efforts. This project complements Alstom’s long-standing presence in Greece,” said Stavros Vlachos, Alstom Managing Director for Greece. \nThe introduction of high-speed trains is a key component of Greek operator TRAINOSE’s plan to reduce current journey times on the main Athens-Thessaloniki axis from 4 hours to around 3 hours following the completed infrastructure upgrades.\n“Starting high-speed service in Greece with these upgraded Alstom trains is part of our strategy to offer an improved passenger experience, better quality services and reduced travel time on a very popular route. Moreover, the upgrade of our Thessaloniki depot as part of this project will turn our depots into some of the most modern and high-tech depots in South-East Europe,” said CEO of TRAINOSE, Professor Filippos Tsalidis.\nAlstom’s high-speed Avelia range is based on three current flagship products: Avelia Pendolino, Avelia Euroduplex and Avelia AGV, totalling 35 years of experience in commercial service. Avelia Pendolino high-speed train is certified in 14 countries and more than 520 trains have been sold in countries such as Italy, Spain, UK, Poland, Portugal, Russia and China. \nThe Avelia Pendolino is a flexible and interoperable passenger rail solution for high-speed and conventional lines, running at up to 250 km/h. One of the most proven high-speed trains in the world and truly cross-border, the Avelia Pendolino benefits from Alstom’s four decades of high-speed experience. Its success rests primarily on its modularity and flexibility. Avelia Pendolino is mainly produced at Alstom\'s Savigliano factory in Italy and its first entry into commercial service dates from 1988. The modernization applied to this ETR 470 Pendolino fleet demonstrates Alstom’s commitment to supporting customers in the adaptation of their assets during the whole life cycle and leveraging the flexibility of the Avelia Pendolino product.',NULL,NULL,1),(1131,'Alstom','Alstom wins major signalling & telecommunication systems contract for rapid rail line between Delhi and Meerut','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/1/alstom-wins-major-signalling-telecommunication-systems-contract-rapid','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/01/20/20210120_thumbnail_Delhi_Meerut_ETCS_EN_0.png?itok=_RzTFD2b','20 Jan 2021','2023-09-20 17:21:30','',NULL,NULL,1),(1132,'Alstom','Alstom’s orders and sales for the first nine months of 2020/21','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/1/alstoms-orders-and-sales-first-nine-months-202021','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/01/19/thumbnail%20EN.png?itok=s7E0niyC','19 Jan 2021','2023-09-20 17:21:36','',NULL,NULL,1),(1133,'Alstom','Alstom innovates towards a sustainable future for rail transport & mobility in Saudi Arabia','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/1/alstom-innovates-towards-sustainable-future-rail-transport-mobility','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/01/11/DSC_5771.JPG?itok=xrU2vsY5','12 Jan 2021','2023-09-20 17:21:42','Press contact: Middle East and Turkey\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Bahaa Omran \n      \n              Send an email,12 January 2021 – Alstom, a global leader in rail transport and sustainable mobility, is proving to be a key supporter and facilitator of Saudi Arabia’s goal to comprehensively enhance the interconnectivity of the Kingdom and the development of major rail and metro projects, in line with its Vision for 2030.  Having been an integral part of Saudi Arabia’s history for almost 70 years, Alstom is now proudly playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of transport systems and infrastructure in the Kingdom, by delivering best-in-class mobility solutions and projects. \nIn alignment with the Kingdom’s overall growth and in response to the ever-increasing public demand for the expansion of land transportation services, Saudi Arabia has continuously reiterated its commitment to developing an additional 10,000km of rail and metro by 2030. A key factor in this commitment is the country’s ambition to lead the way in reducing transport emissions, relieving traffic congestion, improving residents’ health and quality of life, and progressively decarbonising rail transit in the Middle East.\nBy 2024, Saudi Arabia is expected to have spent over $48bn on rail projects throughout the Kingdom. At the forefront of this major investment in rail transport is the Riyadh Metro: the largest single-phase metro system project ever launched in the world. An ongoing project, the Riyadh Metro’s lines 4, 5 and 6 have been built from scratch by Alstom and its civil partners, as part of the FAST consortium, and the fully integrated metro system is set to provide comprehensive, citywide, mass-transit coverage. \nAlstom has supplied 69 Metropolis™ -based Riyadh Metro trains and an Urbalis signalling system. As a leader in the improvement of environmental performance of rail across the region, Alstom has also implemented highly advanced and innovative HESOP™ (Harmonic Energy Saver) technology in the project. HESOP™ recovers the electrical energy generated by trains during braking, which, in addition to reducing operational costs, will cut about 3 million kilograms of carbon emissions and decrease power consumption by 6.6 million kilowatts per annum. \n“Saudi Arabia has a long and rich history of innovation across various industries, and Alstom is extremely proud to have been entrusted by the Kingdom to have such a strong presence in driving that innovation in its transport and energy industries for almost 70 years.

Planned to be deployed for operations on major freight routes, including the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), these e-Locos are transforming the heavy freight transportation landscape of India. Over these 5 years, major progress has been made on the largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) project in the Indian Railway sector.\n \nCertified by the Ministry of Railways and Commissioner of Railway Safety / RDSO earlier this year, the first WAG 12B e-Loco was inducted for commercial services in May 2020. So far, Alstom has successfully manufactured and delivered 50 such e-Locos to the Indian Railways. These e-Locos have covered close to 2 million kilometres on the railway network till date.\n“Alstom is proud to partner in India’s growth story. Today, as we look back at an eventful five-year journey, it gives me immense pride to state that we have made progress across a spectrum of spheres – technological, infrastructural and socioeconomic – alike”, says Alain Spohr, Managing Director, Alstom India & South Asia.  \nBasis the contract, which includes an associated maintenance of the e-Locos for over a period of 13 years, a joint venture was formed between the Indian Railways, Ministry of Railways (26% equity) and Alstom (74% equity) to set up one of India’s largest integrated greenfield manufacturing facilities at Madhepura, Bihar. Spread across 250 acres, with a production capacity of 120 locomotives per annum, this industrial site is built to international standards of safety and quality. Alstom will deliver 75 units in FY 20/21 & 100 units annually starting next fiscal. \nFlagging off the first e-Loco from the Madhepura facility on April 10, 2018, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had said, “I am thrilled to flag off the first-ever 12000 HP engine. There are very few countries across the world that use locomotives of this scale and power for freight transport. These engines will upscale the speed of freight transport in India to two times faster”.[1]\nHighlighting India’s Green Railways dream, Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways, Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs and Food & Public Distribution, Government of India had said, “Our PM has approved a program for 100% electrification of Indian Railways. We\'ll be the largest railways in the world to be 100% electrified with 120,000 track kms across India. By 2030, we hope to be the world\'s first 100% green railway with net-zero emission.”[2]\n \nWith these powerful e-Locos being manufactured within the country, India has become the 6th country in the world to join the club of countries producing high horsepower locomotives indigenously. \nThe project also includes setting up of two ultramodern maintenance depots in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh and Nagpur, Maharashtra. These depots are equipped with latest technologies and features to anticipate breakdowns and take proactive measures, thereby playing a substantial role in maintaining India’s most advanced freight locomotives at significantly lower costs. The depot in Saharanpur is currently operational and comes with a ‘Training Centre’ equipped with a loco simulator and smart classrooms for skill development of railway employees and loco pilots. Till date, more than 500 loco pilots from Indian Railways have been trained and going forward, an additional 500 will be trained annually. The Nagpur depot will be functional soon.\n \n\"The relationship between India and France, dating back to many decades, is imbued with a shared vision in across many fields. This joint venture, the largest FDI project for Indian Railways, has only strengthened our spirit to employ world-class technology for a safer, faster and more carbon-efficient service. As we continue to strengthen the Indo-French partnership, we hope to see our collaborations bring real-time impacts on the lives of the people”, said Emmanuel Lenain, Ambassador of France to India.\n“Globally, Alstom is associated with almost every prominent Railway organization and Indian Railways, is one of the largest Railway entities in the world. The joint venture combines innovation with responsibility and together we are committed to deliver safe, reliable and efficient solutions. India is at the cusp of a logistics revolution and we are excited to be part of this journey”, added Alain Spohr.\n \nTechnical Superiority & Localization\nLocomotives manufactured at Madhepura are of 12,000-horsepower with a twin Bo-Bo design, engineered to run at a speed that is twice as faster than regular locomotives and are built to carry 6000 tonnes of goods in one go. Equipped with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based propulsion technology, the WAG 12B uses regenerative braking, reducing energy consumption. Moreover, with this e-Loco, Alstom is introducing freight trains that emit lesser heat and traction noise. With 1676mm of Broad Gauge, the e-locos are designed to take smooth turns even at the sharpest of curves.\nThe e-Locos designed at Alstom’s Engineering Centre in Bengaluru, use an eight-axle design that would enhance performance of a locomotive. The Prima T8 technology makes operation comfortable and flexible in extreme temperatures, ranging from −50 °C to 50 °C. With this, Alstom introduces novel features into Indian freight trains, such as climate control systems, air conditioners, food preparation and storage facilities and toilets. The WAG 12B e-locos are also equipped with spacious cabins for pilots to work comfortably. Localization has been made a reality with over 85% of indigenization. \nSocio-economic effect\nAlstom’s joint venture with the Indian Railways has created over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in various Indian states. To support the local communities, Alstom is actively investing into the upliftment of the community across seven villages in and around Madhepura, covering education, healthcare, women empowerment and skilling.

Thanks to digital data analysis, it identifies the optimal moment for component replacement. The system implemented in Warsaw builds on Alstom’s long experience in the United Kingdom, where TrainScanner has been used in servicing Avanti West Coast’s Pendolino fleet for years.  \n“We are very proud to be inaugurating this TrainScanner in mainland Europe. It is another milestone towards the future of mobility. Thanks to automated, data-based solutions, we can continuously improve predictive maintenance processes, which translates into direct benefits for operators and passengers. Predictive and condition-based assessment of the fleet’s technical condition helps avoid downtime and maximises availability,” said Artur Fryczkowski, Managing Director Alstom in Poland and Ukraine.\n“TrainScanner is a glimpse of the future of the industry. I am glad that PKP Intercity trains will be inspected in this innovative way, as this will not only bring us savings, but above all will allow us to ensure greater reliability of our trains, and thus the comfort and safety of passengers,” stresses Adam Laskowski, Board Member of PKP Intercity S.A., Polish national long-distance carrier, whose rolling stock flees includes 20 Alstom’s Pendolinos.\nUsing 3D cameras and lasers, TrainScanner automatically enables condition-based and predictive maintenance for wheels, brake pads and pantograph carbon strips as well as on under-frames and body shells. Especially suitable for large or dispersed fleets or when high level of service is required, subsystem information is captured as the train passes through the TrainScanner. After automated inspection, the data is transmitted to Alstom’s HealthHub platform, which translates raw data into actionable information, by using rule-based algorithms, leading to the calculation of a health index for each asset.\nTrainScanner and HealthHub provide significant benefits in terms of both maintenance and operation, lowering the consumption of materials and the number of required maintenance activities, and thus enabling significant savings for fleet owners and operators. The system contributes to longer intervals between maintenance, longer component life and increased safety during operation.\nAlstom has been present in Poland for over 20 years, with a local workforce of almost 2000 employees.

This new exercise of options points to the relevance of this versatile transport solution and to the renewed trust of our customers, Île-de-France Mobilités and Transilien SNCF,\" said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France. \nDesigned to meet the increased need for mobility between urban and suburban networks, the Citadis Dualis tram-train links the centre of town with the suburbs without any break in continuity, by combining the advantages of the train with those of the tram. Based on the design of Alstom\'s Citadis tram, the Dualis version retains the fundamental characteristics that made Citadis so successful: modularity, accessibility and reliability. Citadis Dualis can run on a tram network just as easily as on a regional rail network thanks to certain adaptations in power, safety and comfort. This configuration makes it a versatile means of transport: it has the same gauge as a tram, meaning it can circulate in town, while its performance, the same as that of a train, enables it to carry passengers at nearly 100 km/h in outlying areas without having to change transport modes. Citadis Dualis plays a role in sustainable mobility by revitalising urban spaces and enhancing the architectural heritage of cities. \nTo date, 78 Citadis Dualis tram-trains are in operation in France. This includes 30 in Île-de-France, 24 in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and 24 in Pays-de-la-Loire. In 2018, Alstom received an order to supply 34 additional Citadis Dualis tram-trains to Île-de-France Mobilités and Transilien SNCF, with Île-de-France Mobilités covering 100% of the investment cost of the trains. 23 tram-trains are destined for the T12 Massy/Evry line and 11 for the T13 Express Saint-Cyr/Saint-Germain line. These trains are currently being developed and manufactured at Alstom\'s Valenciennes Petite-Forêt site.\nSeven of Alstom\'s sites in France are involved in the design and manufacture: Valenciennes for the trains and project management, Ornans for the motors, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction drive components, Villeurbanne for the on-board computerised systems and passenger information, Petit-Quevilly for the transformers, and Saint-Ouen for design.\nIn Europe, more than 200 Alstom tram-trains (Citadis Dualis and Regio Citadis) have already been sold, covering more than 50 million kilometres. This Alstom technology is also being exported via the Citadis Spirit, adapted to the North American market and adopted by the cities of Ottawa and Toronto in Canada in 2013 and 2017.',NULL,NULL,1),(1162,'Alstom','The first REM car unveiled in Montreal','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/11/first-rem-car-unveiled-montreal','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/11/16/Alstom_REM_Brossard_20201111_0226.jpg?itok=3329HpC_','16 Nov 2020','2023-09-20 17:24:36','',NULL,NULL,1),(1163,'Alstom','Alstom Foundation to support 29 new projects around the world including one in Italy','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/11/alstom-foundation-support-29-new-projects-around-world-including-one','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/09/_m7a5906.jpg?itok=pcPp53Gm','12 Nov 2020','2023-09-20 17:24:42','',NULL,NULL,1),(1164,'Alstom','Alstom, the first rail actor in France to obtain Qualiopi certification','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/11/alstom-first-rail-actor-france-obtain-qualiopi-certification','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/11/12/LogoQualiopi_0.jpg?itok=qZldNbH3','12 Nov 2020','2023-09-20 17:24:48','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,12 November 2020 – Alstom\'s training centre in France, which groups together the training activities carried out by Alstom\'s teams at the sites of Valenciennes and Saint-Ouen, has now been Qualiopi certified by AFNOR. Alstom is the first actor in the rail sector to obtain this certification. \nThe Qualiopi certification confirms the quality of Alstom\'s training processes. It covers the whole catalogue, i.e. some forty training courses given by 12 permanent trainers and approximately fifty people working on an occasional basis. The catalogue includes product training such as train driving and maintenance, training in special processes such as welding, painting and cabling, as well as training in industrial culture such as quality and safety.\n\"The Qualiopi certification attests to the pedagogical expertise and the quality of our training activities. We are the first railway company to be certified and recognised as a training professional. This is proof of our ability to contribute to developing skills, to be a training stakeholder in the regional and national economic context, and to propose a comprehensive offer that also enables our customers to claim financial support from the State, the Regions or even the OPCOs, the official bodies responsible for supporting vocational training,\" explains Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\nThe training courses are primarily aimed at customers, but also at service providers and subcontractors. They can be given on our sites as well as on customer sites. Many training courses, such as those for driving, welding or painting, draw on the use of virtual reality simulators to encourage learning. In 2020, in spite of the COVID-19 epidemic, 800 people have already been trained by Alstom\'s training centre in France. Obtaining Qualiopi certification should attract additional trainees, particularly from our transport operator customers.\nThis certification is granted for a period of 4 years.

Earlier this year, Indian Railways began inducting the WAG 12B e-locos, which are the most powerful locomotives to run on Indian tracks. Cumulatively, these electric locomotives have already clocked over 1 million kilometres, thus providing a significant fillip to the country’s freight logistics landscape.\nThese electric locos will allow faster and safer movement of heavier freight trains capable to haul ~6000 tonnes at a top speed of 120 kmph. Planned to be deployed for operations on major freight routes of Indian Railways including the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), they are expected to increase the average speed of freight trains in India by at least 20-25 kmph.\nCommenting on this achievement, Alain SPOHR, Managing Director, Alstom India & South Asia said, “The approval from RDSO is indeed a matter of pride for all of us at Alstom and a testimony of our technical expertise in partnership with the Indian Railways. In line with India’s push towards self-reliance, we have successfully leveraged our local engineering and manufacturing capabilities. Alstom is also committed to support IR in reducing its carbon footprint and adopt cleaner technologies in its quest to transform into the world’s largest Green Railway network. India is a priority for Alstom, and we are committed to work closely with the Indian Railways for all their future modernization endeavours.” \n“Equipped with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based propulsion technology, it would lead to considerable savings in energy consumption due to use of regenerative braking. The technology is also helpful towards making the acceleration process more efficient by reducing the heat generation and traction noise. Additionally, this move will not only bring down operational costs, but also reduce the congestion faced by Indian Railways”, he added.\nDespite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the advent of Unlock 1.0, Alstom restarted significant production at all its manufacturing facilities, ensuring all necessary permissions and adhering to government protocols.

This initial 1:1-scale model in the colours of Île-de-France Mobilités gives a stunning idea of the new metros that will be delivered by Alstom following monumental works by the Société du Grand Paris. I am certain that if their technical performance is as successful as their design, Île-de-France region passengers will be especially proud of their metro.”\nValérie Pécresse, President of the Île-de-France Region and President of Île-de-France Mobilités\n\"We are very pleased to be able to reveal, with our partners Île-de-France Mobilités and Alstom, a full-scale mock-up of a metro car from the Grand Paris Express, which will allow future users to discover the new metro on a site open to everyone, the Fabrique du Métro. The exhibition \"Les lignes du design\" is a preview of what a journey on the Grand Paris Express will be like, from arrival in the station right up to the journey in the metro as of 2024. This new metro will be environmentally friendly, accessible to all, fast, reliable and comfortable, which is what\'s expected of a means of transport today.\"  \nThierry Dallard, Chairman of the Management Board of the Société du Grand Paris\n\"Two years after signing the rolling stock contract for lines 15, 16 and 17, we are proud and happy to present, alongside our partners, Île-de-France Mobilités and Société du Grand Paris, the design of this future metro. This phase concludes two years of engineering work just as we are launching the production of the metro. We have designed and will produce a state-of-the-art metro that benefits from the latest technologies, offering high performance and a renewed passenger experience.\" \nHenri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and CEO of Alstom\nLines 15, 16 and 17 will be equipped with state-of-the-art driverless automatic metros developed from solutions from Alstom\'s Metropolis range. These metros will guarantee the highest levels of availability, reliability and safety expected by passengers. With cars 2.8m wide, each metro will be able to carry approximately 500 passengers in its 3-car version and around 1,000 passengers in its 6-car version. Commercial speed will be between 55 and 65 km/h with peak speeds of up to 110 km/h. The automatic train operation will ensure travel comfort, with acceleration and braking controlled by automated driving systems combined with an efficient suspension system.\nIn collaboration with Île-de-France Mobilités, the Société du Grand Paris, its prime contractor Systra and its design agency RCP Design Global, and taking the expectations of public transport users into account, Alstom\'s Design&Styling office has created an interior design that offers a fluid, comfortable passenger journey. The interior layout of the metros is designed to be both high in capacity and comfortable.\nWith very wide interior circulation and a variety of grip fixtures, passengers can move around easily and choose the space that suits them. The design of the front end offers passengers a new comfort zone and a panoramic view thanks to a very wide windscreen, a panoramic console, and seating on both sides. The seats are comfortable with high backrests, wide legroom, isolating armrests, a transversal layout (solo seats and face-to-face duos) and a longitudinal layout (bench-style) to encourage passenger circulation on board the train and enhance the sensation of fluidity and space. Standing travel is also more comfortable with ischiatic supports at the rear of the seats and in the mixed areas, ergonomic hand holds, and circulation areas treated like travel spaces. Passengers in wheelchairs and people with children in pushchairs or with large suitcases are easily accommodated with two zones dedicated to wheelchair users per train and mixed spaces in each car. The priority seats are numerous and easy to identify by their specific colour. \nThe journey is also pleasant with the sensation of an enlarged space, thanks to clean-cut shapes associated with light colours, and lighting resembling natural light which varies according to the time of day, adjusting to the biological rhythm of the passengers to improve well-being. For greater comfort and safety, the metro is accessed underneath reinforced lighting on the platform and on the vehicle threshold. The spaces under the seats are completely unobstructed and equipped with lighting, which reinforces the feeling of security. Information is always within the passenger\'s reach, via screens grouped together in a continuous strip throughout the entire metro. USB sockets for charging phones and tablets are also provided. Each car is equipped with powerful ventilation, air conditioning and heating systems to ensure thermal comfort in all seasons. \nThe metro\'s environmental performance is guaranteed by a number of innovations. 100% electric service braking, a system for recovering the energy generated by braking and the widespread use of LED lighting will help to optimise electricity consumption. The use of electric braking will limit particle emissions. The rolling stock will be more than 98% recyclable. \nFinally, particular attention has been paid to optimising the maintenance of the new metro. The on-board diagnostic system will pass on information about the condition of the train equipment and give maintenance staff a complete overview of the condition of the fleet, making it easier to plan corrective and predictive maintenance tasks. These new metros will meet demands to optimise maintenance operations with the aim of reducing maintenance costs over the entire life cycle.\nThis rolling stock project, financed entirely by Île-de-France Mobilités, contributes actively to the solidity of the rail sector and its foothold in France. 350 Alstom employees at eight sites in France, including 150 engineers, will work on this project. The project will also provide 800 jobs for French suppliers. In total, around 1,150 jobs will be secured within the French rail industry.',NULL,NULL,1),(1190,'Alstom','Trial runs of Alstom’s hydrogen train in the Netherlands deemed officially successful','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/9/trial-runs-alstoms-hydrogen-train-netherlands-deemed-officially','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/09/30/web_20200304-020742_SV6782.jpg?itok=nTL2JMsn','30 Sep 2020','2023-09-20 17:27:08','Press contact - Belgium - Luxemburg- Netherlands\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Sonia Thibaut \n      \n              Send an email,The Province of Groningen publishes results of Coradia iLint tests conducted in March 2020\n\nReady to run on the Dutch network \nSame commercial service performance as traditional regional diesel trains\nRefueling fast and safe \nZero emissions and low noise\n\n30 September 2020 – The Province of Groningen has published a report outlining the results of the Coradia iLint tests performed in March on the 65 kilometers of line between Groningen and Leeuwarden in the north of the Netherlands.  The tests aimed to investigate whether a hydrogen fuel cell train could be a fully sustainable alternative to the diesel trains currently running in the northern part of the country. \nThe Alstom’s hydrogen train has been extensively tested with the Province of Groningen operator Arriva, the Dutch railway infrastructure manager ProRail and the energy company Engie. DEKRA, an independent testing inspection and certification company, was the test leader. The tests took place without passengers.\nThe report states that Alstom’s hydrogen train has successfully met the 4 objectives of the test frame: authorisation by the Dutch NSA (National Safety Assessor) to run on the Dutch railway network, fully zero emission and perfectly fitting the commercial service of the current timetable, quick and easy refuelling, and familiarisation of the general public to hydrogen mobility.\n“After Germany, the Netherlands is the second country in Europe where the Alstom’s hydrogen train has proven itself a unique emissions-free solution for non-electrified lines.  The tests have demonstrated how our hydrogen train is mature in terms of availability and reliability, providing the same performance as diesel equipment, and with the benefit of low noise and zero emissions. The Coradia iLint hydrogen train supports the transition towards global sustainable transport systems,” said Bernard Belvaux, Managing Director, Alstom Benelux.   \nRegarding the commercial service performance: both the stop timetable (all stations) and the express timetable have been tested successfully. Hydrogen consumption, infrastructure compatibility, acceleration, braking, docking, maximal speed, performance of the auxiliaries, all operations went without problems.  \nThe Dutch drivers found the behaviour of the train comfortable, smooth and easy to drive. Refuelling with green hydrogen went faster than expected and was performed safely. Moreover, this zero-emission train is significantly quieter than the current diesel trains. This was confirmed during the tests and is a significant benefit for the passengers and inhabitants on the line. \nThe report concludes that the goals have all been achieved and that the hydrogen train is a fully viable alternative to diesel equipment.\nDownload the report :',NULL,NULL,1),(1191,'Alstom','Railway on the fast track to implementing sustainable mobility in the Middle East','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/9/railway-fast-track-implementing-sustainable-mobility-middle-east','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/07/02/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200622182509202_COVER_1.jpg?itok=98H6qQHX','29 Sep 2020','2023-09-20 17:27:12','',NULL,NULL,1),(1192,'Alstom','Alstom to provide digital train control, traffic management and electrification infrastructure for the Rhine-Danube rail corridor','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/9/alstom-provide-digital-train-control-traffic-management-and','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2021/02/25/Romania%2C%20Border-Curtici-Arad-km%20614%20project_overview.JPG?itok=bbEKNz3I','23 Sep 2020','2023-09-20 17:27:18','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email,Travel time reduced to one hour between the cities of Sighisoara and Brasov in Romania\n\nAlstom project value: 70 million EUR \nTravel time reduced to one hour on Sighisoara-Brasov section thanks to modernised infrastructure \nAlstom working on 75% of the 450 km currently in rehabilitation on the Romanian section of the European rail corridor\n\n23 September 2020 – Alstom will provide digital train control, traffic management and electrification infrastructure as part of the rehabilitation and modernisation of Lot 2 (Apata-Cata) on the Sighisoara-Brasov section of the European Rhine-Danube rail corridor in Romania. Alstom’s share of the contract amounts to approximately €70 million. The Asocierea RailWorks consortium, of which Alstom is part, has signed the contract, with the project execution expected to last four years.  \nThis project completes the previous one for Lots 1 and 3 of the same section, which was awarded to Asocierea RailWorks in March 2020. In total, Alstom will provide signalling and electrification works on the double line covering the railway distance of 128 kilometres – totalling more than 250 kilometres of modernized railway infrastructure – between Sighisoara and Brasov, two important touristic destinations in Romania. \n“Alstom has now reinforced its leading position on the Romanian railway market, for both digital train control and electrification. Covering the entire subsection between Sighisoara and Brasov will provide a smooth and effective operation, ensuring a consistency in the quality of service and coordinated efforts to complete the entire subsection on time and budget,” explains Gabriel Stanciu, Alstom Managing Director for Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova. \nThe new project, totalling 28 kilometres of double railway line, includes the optimisation of the existing route by building tunnels to reduce travel time, as well as the modernisation of most of the old line, for passenger trains operating at up to 160 km/h. Alstom is directly responsible for the traffic management system, digital interlocking and ERTMS Level 2 deployment (ETCS Level 2 + GSM-R telecommunications system), passenger information systems as well as catenary upgrades and electric traction substations. \nThe most complex part in this project is the construction of two double tunnels (four tunnels in total, two per each direction) totalling almost 13 kilometres of double lines. In these tunnels, Alstom is responsible for an electro-ventilation system to compensate the lack of natural ventilation, along with a fire-proof system to ensure full traffic safety.\nAs with Lots 1 and 3 of the Sighisoara-Brasov section, for the upgrade of the catenary systems, Alstom will supply its OCS3 catenary solution for main lines. \nTrains have been running between Brașov and Sighișoara since 1873. After completed rehabilitation, the train journey should take under one hour for the fastest trains, compared to 160 to 250 minutes at present. \nAlstom has been active in ongoing rehabilitation works on the Romanian part of the Rhine-Danube Corridor since 2012 and now has five ongoing and two completed signalling and infrastructure projects on this section, covering over 75% of the distance of the 450 km currently in rehabilitation on the Romanian section of the European corridor. \nThe pan-European Rhine-Danube Corridor links the cities of Nuremberg-Prague-Vienna-Budapest-Curtici-Simeria-Brasov-Bucharest-Constanta. Through the rehabilitation programmes currently in implementation on the sections located on the Northern branch of the Romanian part of this Corridor, the traffic speed will increase to 160 km/h for passenger trains and to 120 km/h for freight trains. \nAlstom is a global pioneer in the development and implementation of on-board digital train control equipment.

Until the end of November, a hydrogen train will run for the first time in regular passenger service for ÖBB, the Austrian Federal Railways. The Coradia iLint, built by Alstom in Salzgitter, Germany, uses on-board fuel cells to convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, thus reducing operating emissions to zero. \nFollowing successful test operation in Northern Germany between 2018 and 2020, the Coradia iLint train will now demonstrate its worth in Austria over three months during which it will transport passengers on geographically challenging routes.\n“With its use in regular passenger operations for ÖBB, our innovation train Coradia iLint has reached the next milestone,” said Dr. Jörg Nikutta, Alstom\'s CEO in Germany and Austria, at the launch event in Vienna. “The train’s emission-free drive technology offers a climate-friendly alternative to conventional diesel trains, especially on non-electrified lines. I am particularly pleased that ÖBB, a strong and long-term partner in the European mobility market, is convinced of our technology and its advantages.” \n“We clearly see ourselves as pioneers in testing hydrogen technology on rail. As the largest climate protection company in Austria, we are actively shaping the mobility of the future with technological alternatives,\" emphasizes Andreas Matthä, CEO of ÖBB-Holding AG on the occasion of the premiere of the hydrogen train.\nThe operational success of Alstom\'s fuel cell train started in September 2018, when two pre-series vehicles began regular passenger service in Lower Saxony, Germany. After 1.5 years of trial operation and more than 180,000 kilometres covered, the way was cleared for the delivery of 14 series trains beginning in 2022. Now, the Austrian ÖBB will test the Coradia iLint on regional railway lines in the country’s south, where they could replace diesel trains. Passengers can look forward to a low-noise train with a top speed of 140 km/h and zero emissions.\nAbout the Coradia iLint\nThe Coradia iLint is the first passenger train in the world to run on a hydrogen fuel cell, which generates electrical energy for propulsion. This completely emission-free train is quiet and emits only steam and water. The Coradia iLint is characterized by numerous innovations: clean energy conversion, flexible energy storage in batteries and intelligent management of motive power and available energy. Designed specifically for use on non-electrified lines, it enables clean, sustainable train operation while maintaining high levels of performance.\nAlstom has already sold 41 of these hydrogen-powered trains in Germany. Other countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Italy are also interested in the technology. Alstom is the leader in zero-emission mobility and the only manufacturer able to offer its customers the full range of emission-free drives from electric through to battery and hydrogen fuel cells.',NULL,NULL,1),(1197,'Alstom','Alstom to be included in CAC40 index','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/9/alstom-be-included-cac40-index','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/09/11/5f5901f8b02eb.png?itok=z5MBR70B','11 Sep 2020','2023-09-20 17:27:48','',NULL,NULL,1),(1198,'Alstom','First infrastructure digital inspection for the Madrid Light train network','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/9/first-infrastructure-digital-inspection-madrid-light-train-network','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/09/09/20200710_122719.jpg?itok=h0E2kMVL','09 Sep 2020','2023-09-20 17:27:54','Press contact - Spain and Portugal\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Irma Aguado \n      \n              Send an email,Rail tracks inspection are now more reliable and faster\n\n21-km track \n4 optical units \n4.000 measurements per kilometre\n0,02 mm resolution\n\n10 September 2020 – During the summer, Alstom teams have carried out an innovative project in Spain to digitalise track inspections for Madrid Light train network. The project was performed jointly with the MLO (Madrid Metro Oeste) operator as part of the Services agreement both companies have maintained during the last thirteen years to offer the best service to users through maintenance and systems and infrastructures innovation. \nThis latest digitalization project consisted in the inspection light train lines connecting the west Madrid municipalities with the suburban train stations. The 21-kilometres-track was inspected using TrackTracer technology, Alstom’s innovative track monitoring tool, integrated in a special vehicle that measures the infrastructure automatically. This is the first commercial project of its kind in Spain, after the tests carried out with TMB last year and the R&D projects performed jointly with national infrastructure operator Adif. \nThe vehicle, equipped with four optical units, camera, lasers and an inertial navigation system, analyses various track parameters (such as rail width, levelling, track twist radius, alignment, banking and warping).

Representatives of the state and the companies involved met on site for a symbolic ground-breaking ceremony. An eighteen-month test phase for the first two trains was successfully completed at the end of February. The mobility project, which has attracted worldwide attention, is now entering its next phase.\nThe gases and engineering company Linde will build and operate the hydrogen filling station near Bremervoerde station on behalf of the Lower Saxony Regional Transport Company (LNVG). Other project partners are the rail vehicle manufacturer Alstom, the state of Lower Saxony and the Elbe-Weser Railways and Transport Company (EVB).\nAfter completion expected in mid-2021, the hydrogen filling station will replace the existing mobile filling solution. With a capacity of around 1,600 kg of hydrogen per day, it is nominally one of the largest hydrogen filling stations in the world. From the beginning of 2022, 14 hydrogen-powered regional trains supplied by Alstom will be refuelled there daily and around the clock if necessary. Thanks to a range of 1,000 kilometers, the multiple-unit trains will be able to run emission-free all day long on the EVB network with just one tank filling. Expansion areas at the filling station will allow hydrogen to be produced on site later using electrolysis and regenerative electricity. \n\"The ground-breaking ceremony for this world\'s first hydrogen filling station for passenger trains is an important step for a showcase project from Lower Saxony\", said Carmen Schwabl, Managing Director of LNVG. The initiative to test the gas as a fuel in local rail passenger transport came from LNVG.\n\"We are delighted to play a key role in this world-leading, innovative project,\" said Mathias Kranz, responsible at Linde for the onsite and bulk business in Germany. \"Linde has long been committed to hydrogen, which can make a significant contribution to decarbonisation. The introduction of hydrogen as a fuel for trains will significantly reduce the burden on the environment, as one kilogram of hydrogen replaces approximately 4.5 litres of diesel fuel\".\n\"The construction of the hydrogen filling station in Bremervörde will create the basis for the series operation of our emission-free hydrogen trains in the Weser-Elbe network. We really appreciate that Linde, as an experienced hydrogen supplier, is now also taking over the refuelling of the series trains following the successful trial operation,\" comments Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director Germany and Austria of Alstom.\n\"We are proud that we were the first railway company in the world with permission to operate fuel cell trains on the Weser-Elbe network. Our passengers were very curious about the trains and their technology from the very beginning. In addition to the very low noise level, the hydrogen train impresses with its zero emissions, especially in times of climate change. For our train drivers, the operation of iLint was a very special motivation\", said Andreas Wagner, head of the SPNV division and authorized signatory of the Eisenbahnen und Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser GmbH (evb).     \nThe project is subsidized by the national innovation programme for hydrogen and fuel cell technology of the Federal Ministry of Transport, and Digital Infrastructure NOW GmbH will coordinate the funding guideline and Project Management Jülich (PtJ) is responsible for the implementation.\nAbout the Coradia iLint\nCoradia iLint is the first passenger train in the world to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which generates electrical energy for propulsion. This completely emission-free train is quiet and emits only water vapor and condensation water. The train features several different innovations: clean energy conversion, flexible energy storage in batteries and intelligent management of motive power and available energy. Designed specifically for use on non-electrified lines, it enables clean, sustainable train operations.\nAbout Linde\nLinde is a leading global industrial gases and engineering company with 2019 sales of $28 billion (€25 billion).

The certified energy is supplied by Tauron, the second largest electricity generator and supplier in Poland, and the green energy comes directly from water and wind RES installations owned by Tauron Ekoenergia.\nIn addition to this first action, Alstom has launched the “Plastic Free” campaign. In the first stage, the goal is to eliminate plastic cups and bottles. Consequently, the company ended access to plastic bottled drinks and handed over water bottles to all employees, encouraging to use them at work on daily basis. Next step is to reduce the packaging of production materials delivered to Alstom. Thanks to these efforts, Alstom in Poland will eliminate minimum 9 tons of plastic per year.\n“With the onset of 2020, we signed a contract for 12,000 MWh of energy certified by a Guarantee of Origin, corresponding to 100% of the estimated annual consumption of our Chorzów site. This is a massive amount of green energy. By comparison, this amount of energy would provide light and power all electric appliances in more than three thousand households for an entire year” – explains Paweł Siwek, Managing Director, Alstom Konstal S.A.\n“Switching to renewable energy sources is another milestone in Alstom’s sustainability strategy, as well as our local success. Alstom undertakings within CSR & Sustainability strategies involve also activities dedicated to employees and subcontractors.  The “plastic free” campaign is a good example which will  allow us to eliminate 9 tons of plastic per year.” highlights Artur Fryczkowski, President, Alstom Polska.\nSustainable and smart mobility are the pillars of Alstom’s innovation strategy, which provides a solid foundation for the future of mobility. Under Alstom in Motion strategy, the Energy Saving Plan has been carried out consistently as part of the company’s commitment to electricity decarbonisation in their sites around the world.\nThe Energy Saving Plan focuses on 20 major energy consumers within Alstom that account for over 90% of the company’s global consumption. As part of the activities, contracts are signed for the supply of green energy from third-party suppliers.\nAlstom’s continued commitment to sustainable mobility has been recognised by independent experts. In recent years, the company has been listed in the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World index by Corporate Knights, and in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe Index (DJSI), which demonstrates Alstom’s true leadership in the field of sustainability.',NULL,NULL,1),(1213,'Alstom','Digital Twins and driverless shunting: the future is now','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/7/digital-twins-and-driverless-shunting-future-now','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/07/24/Lok%20Nachts.JPG?itok=N-CBVmRb','22 Jul 2020','2023-09-20 17:29:12','Recent developments in autonomous driving in rail\nAutonomous driving, known by experts as ATO (“automatic train operation”), enables the rail sector to save energy by regulating traction and braking efforts, and therefore increasing network capacity by reducing the timetable margin. This leads to more reliable operation and increased traffic. While ATO is already in use in the metro sector, as well as in urban mainlines such as in Paris, this technology has been little used for freight transport and passenger transport on non-urban mainlines. \nThe environment of railway lines requires a different approach and different standards than metro lines. The operational monitoring and control of all traffic is more complex. Main lines have complicated train schedules with different railway operators. If one train is delayed, this affects all other connections. Most main lines have combined passenger and freight traffic as well as a large variety of rolling stock, which makes monitoring challenging.\nRailway operators, infrastructure owners and the industry are currently in the exploration phase to test different use-cases.

This investment from Alstom and Eversholt Rail in the UK hydrogen train will underpin other initiatives in the hydrogen sector and will support any subsequent national hydrogen strategy. \nBreeze trains will be built at Alstom’s Widnes Transport Technology Centre, which is fast becoming the UK’s premier centre for train modernisation. Widnes will also become Alstom’s worldwide centre of excellence for hydrogen conversion when this project is in series production, creating over 200 high quality engineering jobs in the North West, crucial for the Prime Minister’s levelling-up agenda.\nWhen powered by green hydrogen, these trains offer true zero-emission mobility, not just zero emission at point of use. The only emission from a hydrogen train is water; it produces no harmful particulate or gaseous emissions.\nHydrogen trains are ideally suited to regional rail services on routes that are not currently electrified. Alstom has already proven that hydrogen trains are a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution with the success of the Coradia iLint in Germany. This new investment will ensure that Breeze trains are ready for swift deployment in the UK wherever electrification with overhead wires might be impractical or visually intrusive. \nThe pioneering of a hydrogen train fleet is a notable step in the path towards decarbonising the UK railway. As Breeze will be the first UK train fleet to use the Class 6xx category, it will bear the classification ‘600’. Both Eversholt Rail and Alstom are delighted with this recognition.\n“It’s time to jump-start the UK hydrogen revolution. With the Government looking to invest in green technologies, Alstom and Eversholt Rail have deepened our already extensive commitment to this job-creating technology with a further million-pound investment. This bold move to back the Government’s ambitions on hydrogen means we are the only game in town if you want a shovel ready British hydrogen train. The Breeze is good to go, wherever the Government commits to upgrading Britain’s railway with hydrogen trains,” said Nick Crossfield, Managing Director, UK & Ireland\nMary Kenny, CEO of Eversholt Rail, said “Eversholt Rail has a proud record of innovation in key rolling stock technologies and this further investment in the Breeze programme demonstrates our commitment to providing timely, cost-effective solutions to the identified need for hydrogen trains to support the decarbonisation of the UK railway”.\nAbout Eversholt Rail \nEversholt Rail owns UK passenger and freight rolling stock and has more than 25 years’ experience in the rail industry. Eversholt Rail has invested more than £3bn in new trains since privatisation and continually invests in existing fleets to maintain quality and reliability to deliver a better passenger experience. Eversholt Rail has a proud history of innovation and plays an integral role in the growth and modernisation of the UK rail sector by introducing new products and technologies into the market.\nAbout the Breeze train\nBreeze is a train powered by hydrogen. It brings hydrogen train technology, proven in passenger service on Alstom’s Coradia iLint trains in Germany, to the UK. To make it, Alstom will rebuild Eversholt Rail’s Class 321 electric trains to use hydrogen power. Alstom will do the work at our Widnes facility in the Liverpool City Region. First fleet production would create more than 200 jobs. When more trains are ordered, this number would grow. The Breeze hydrogen trains will be replacements for the UK’s regional diesels that operate across the country and the first trains could be in service in 2024. \nAbout the Class 600\nAll UK trains have a class number, made of three digits, with the first of the three digits explaining the type of train it is. The Breeze is the first ever hydrogen train for the UK, which requires a new ‘class’, beginning with a 6. The 600 series will be reserved for alternative traction like hydrogen, and as the Breeze is the first of this type, it will have the first number, 600.',NULL,NULL,1),(1215,'Alstom','Alstom, Indra and Constructora San Jose to supply tunnel safety and security systems for Spain’s new Madrid-Asturias high-speed line','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/7/alstom-indra-and-constructora-san-jose-supply-tunnel-safety-and-security','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/07/17/CopyrightAdif_Pajares%20tunnel%20works.jpg?itok=BNLWBXeR','20 Jul 2020','2023-09-20 17:29:21','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - Spain and Portugal\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Irma Aguado \n      \n              Send an email,Alstom, in consortium with Indra and Constructora San Jose[1], has signed a €53 million contract[2]with Spanish railway infrastructure authority Adif to supply and install the safety and security systems for twelve tunnels in the Pajares Bypass high speed connection.\nThe 49-kilometre Pajares Bypass, which joins the municipalities of La Robla (León) and Pola de Lena (Asturias), is part of the future León - Asturias High Speed Line (LAV), which will substantially improve the railway connection between Madrid and the North of Spain. The project includes, includes a 25-kilometre bi-directional tunnel, the second longest tunnel in Spain, and will allow trains to cross the Cantabrian Mountains at high speed. \nThe consortium will supply the safety and security systems for the tunnels, including ventilation and firefighting systems, fire doors, emergency radio and gas detection. Alstom will also provide the power supply for the entire system and will integrate it into the customer’s remote-control Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA). Assistance and emergency responses are also part of the package.\nAlstom and Indra teams have long experience in similar projects on the Spanish rail network. Specifically, the companies have already equipped and maintained electromechanical installations in 32 tunnels associated with the Ourense-Santiago line, and 4 tunnels on the Madrid-Valladolid high-speed line, including the Guadarrama tunnel – the longest in Spain.  Alstom and Indra have also jointly installed security systems in the tunnels of the high-speed line between Antequera and Granada.\nConstructora San Jose has executed various sections of the main high-speed lines in Spain (Madrid - Zaragoza - Barcelona - French Border, Madrid - Valencia, Madrid -Galicia, Madrid - Asturias, etc.), highlighting the Contreras - Villargordo del Cabriel one of the most  challenged in Spain (85% of the route is made up of 3 tunnels and 3 viaducts, among them the Contreras one with the largest concrete railway arch in Europe).\nPajares bypass\nPajares Bypass will allow passenger and freight trains to cross the Cantabrian Mountains at high speed. The installation of the security systems will contribute to easier, faster and more reliable connections between Madrid and the north of Spain.  It will reduce the travel time on the Madrid-Valladolid-León-Oviedo / Gijón route and will ease the railway connection with the Asturian ports.

The solution allows operators to adapt, easily and in real time, their offer to the various social distancing and public gathering requirements that have arisen due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThanks to big data and machine learning, Mastria gives operators higher visibility on passenger distribution and flow in trains and stations, as well as enhanced predictive capabilities. This equates to the ability to anticipate and control passenger density and operations in real time, adapting train frequency, capacity and the required number of trains, as well as passenger flows into stations, among other things. Matching the supply of trains with the demand optimises operating conditions, including costs, and is especially useful for managing fluctuating demand peaks, such as during rush hours or special events, or special mobility restrictions, as in the case of Covid-19.\nThe new implementation of Mastria aggregates information on passenger demand from train weight sensors, ticketing machines, traffic signalling, management systems, surveillance cameras and mobile networks in order to offer a real-time picture of passenger flows. From this point, Mastria processes the information and provides operators with the information and recommendations necessary to ensure and anticipate specified levels of occupation, as a percentage of maximum capacity, at all times. It can suggest increasing trains frequency, redistributing the flow of people to particular stations, readjustments to other transport systems that impact the subway, restricting entry to stations or even managing the distribution of passengers on the platform to align them with cars with more space on a given train. Mastria’s powerful prediction algorithms anticipate these situations, allowing proper planning of the entire system.\n“To predict is to prevent”, says Stephane Feray-Beaumont, Vice President Innovation & Smart Mobility of Alstom Digital Mobility. “The ability of this tool to analyse millions of pieces data in real time makes it an indispensable ally for operators at all times, but especially in the current context. Simply put, it matches transport offer to demand, no matter the conditions. All experts agree that public transportation, and particularly rail, will continue to be the backbone of urban mobility. Artificial intelligence will be our best travel partner in this new era of mobility.”\nThe Panama experience\nAlstom implemented Mastria for Panama Metro at the end of last year. The objective was to analyse traveller flows and offer a way to avoid the saturation that appeared at unpredictable times and only in certain stations. In only three months, and thanks to deep learning techniques (artificial neural networks that allow self-learning algorithms), localized saturation could be predicted up to 30 minutes before it could be visibly observed, thereby allowing remedial action that reduced waiting times in stations by 12%.  \nCurrently, in response to the Covid-19 situation, the same technology is being used to adapt the operational actions that maintain the train\'s load to 40% of its maximum capacity, as recommended by the country\'s health authorities. Using various data sources, such as user travel information and the weight of cars, new features have been developed: real-time monitoring of passenger density and flows in stations and trains, with new predictive alerts, simulation of opening and closing access to the stations and analysis of the distribution of passengers throughout the length of the trains.\nMastria technology\nMastria  is based on four main standard functions: multimodal supervision, traffic management, coordination of operations and predictive analysis. These functions are highly configurable and can be combined according to the needs of operators and the global mobility network environment.\nMastria ingests data from external information and control systems through secure network connections. It is flexible and scalable, and adaptable to different transport networks of any size. Mastria can be extended to include new lines or additional means of transportation. Numerous pilot implementations of Mastria’s artificial intelligence technology have already produced results in Paris, Florence, Zaragoza and Panama.',NULL,NULL,1),(1225,'Alstom','Alstom at forefront of hygiene & safety innovation for transport & mobility in a COVID-19 world','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/6/alstom-forefront-hygiene-safety-innovation-transport-mobility-covid-19','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/07/01/covid%20pic%202.jpg?itok=qRjZXPmH','30 Jun 2020','2023-09-20 17:30:18','',NULL,NULL,1),(1226,'Alstom','Alstom obtains certification of latest ETCS standard','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/6/alstom-obtains-certification-latest-etcs-standard','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/06/25/5ef452a91eba1.png?itok=cFy-hYCT','25 Jun 2020','2023-09-20 17:30:24','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press Contact Nordics\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Johanna Svedin\n      \n              Send an email,World-first railway data fusion algorithms to measure the location and speed of trains\n25 June 2020 – Alstom has received full certification[1] of the latest interoperability standard for rail, ETCS[2] Baseline 3 Release 2. Ahead of the large-scale rollout of the solution in Norway, Alstom has also been certified by Belgorail[3] to implement its world-first data fusion algorithms using both satellite navigation and inertial movement to accurately and safely measure the location and speed of trains.  \nInitially created to enable a standardised European cross-border rail traffic, the use of ETCS is set to safely increase speed, reliability, and capacity. ETCS includes continuous radio-based automatic train protection, thus optimising higher-speed operation and supporting network interoperability, while reducing maintenance costs for the operator. The latest standard includes higher radio capacity and other evolutions to better address railways needs.\nThe new odometry system based on data fusion, which Alstom is currently implementing in Norway, is applicable to all types of trains and all environments, including the harshest weather conditions. By 2026, 450 trains will be equipped with the new standard and in commercial service across Norway. Tests for the first locomotive equipped with the new solution will begin in June this year. \n“In a decisive move towards digitalisation in rail, Norway has chosen to equip the whole country with the latest version of the European interoperability standard, demonstrating the country’s leading strategy for a greener future. We are immensely proud to be participating in this, and even more so with a world-first technology for which we have just obtained certification,” says Rob Whyte, Managing Director Alstom Nordics. \nAlstom’s data fusion innovation obviates the need for the external radar components for localisation and speed measurement that are used today. Data fusion is the process of aggregating multiple data sources to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided by any individual data source. In this case being built as a hybrid, with both inertial and satellite sensors for the first time, its equipment is installed within the train, and thus remains unaffected by weather conditions. The algorithms used manage to maintain precision in covered areas such as tunnels. \nAlstom is the worldwide number one in on-board ERTMS equipment via its Atlas solution, representing 70% of the on-board systems in service in ERTMS Level 2. Today, across 30 countries, trains under Atlas supervision have covered over 250 million kilometres, including Deutsche Bahn’s high-speed ICE3 fleet recently equipped in Germany. In total, Alstom has been contracted to equip 9000 trains with Atlas Onboard solutions, of which 1,100 vehicles will be equipped with the Baseline 3 Release 2 solution.  \n[1] ISA and NoBo Certifications\n[2] European Train Control System\n[3] A leading railway certification and testing organisation',NULL,NULL,1),(1227,'Alstom','Alstom reinforces actions to fight coronavirus with the manufacture and donation of face shields','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/6/alstom-reinforces-actions-fight-coronavirus-manufacture-and-donation','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/06/25/20200523_102339.jpg?itok=lw3395kg','24 Jun 2020','2023-09-20 17:30:28','Press contact - Latin America\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Ana Caiasso\n      \n              Send an email,June 24, 2020 - Employees of Alstom, a leader in urban mobility solutions and present for 64 years in Brazil, are manufacturing face shields on 3D printers to fight Covid-19. At the company\'s office in São Paulo, in the Água Branca neighborhood, employees are volunteering to produce about 160 face shields, which are being donated to hospitals and charities. In May and June, 150 units were donated to Hospital e Maternidade Salvalus, in Mooca, east zone of São Paulo. \nIn three weeks, 100 face shields were produced through the voluntary work of four Alstom employees from São Paulo, which guaranteed batches with 10 pieces produced every 22 hours. The company provided the equipment and supplies for 3D printing, but the main investment was the donation of time and dedication from the team, who worked on the manufacturing process for 220 hours.\n\"Alstom is proud of how its teams responded to this unprecedented challenge and encourages everyone, inside or outside the company, to contribute in any way they can to help. The printing of face shields in 3D allows greater flexibility in production, since it depends only on raw material, the equipment and the volunteers\", says Ricardo Koga, Alstom\'s Vice President of Human Resources for Latin America.\nThe headband of the face shields is made of PLA (lactic polyacid), a biodegradable material, that is, not harmful to the environment. The material is widely used for 3D printed parts because of its simple composition and because it is very stable, not warping or suffering from contraction effects during printing. The shield is made of acetate, as recommended by the e-NABLE Brasil website. The initiative to produce face shields on a 3D printer has also taken place in other Alstom units, such as Tarbes and La Rochelle (France), Katowice (Poland), Hornell (USA) and Los Hornos (Argentina).',NULL,NULL,1),(1228,'Alstom','Alstom Belgique a reçu le prix “Factory of the Future 2020”','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/6/alstom-belgique-recu-le-prix-factory-future-2020','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/06/19/Alstom%20Table%20de%20c%C3%A2blage%20num%C3%A9rique%20interactive.jpg?itok=ZGvNp_DF','19 Jun 2020','2023-09-20 17:30:32','Press contact - Belgium - Luxemburg- Netherlands\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Sonia Thibaut \n      \n              Send an email,Deux centres d’excellence mondiaux sur les rails de la transformation numérique \n19 juin 2020 – A l’occasion d’une cérémonie virtuelle, Alstom a reçu le Prix « Factory of the Future 2020 » et rejoint ainsi le club des pionniers wallons et flamands à la pointe de l\'optimisation industrielle. \nOrganisé depuis 2015 par Agoria (Fédération des Entreprises technologiques de Belgique) et l’Agence du Numérique de la Région Wallonne, ce prix récompense les initiatives innovantes et les précurseurs en termes de transformation numérique et technologique.

Built by Alstom and certified by the Ministry of Railways and Commissioner of Railway Safety/RDSO, the electric locomotives – known locally by the designation WAG-12 – are the most powerful locomotives to run on Indian rails. The 2015 contract will see a total of 800 locomotives built for Indian Railways. \nSet to revolutionise freight logistics in the country, the e-locos will allow faster and safer movement of heavy freight trains, capable of hauling 6000 tonnes at a top speed of 120 km/h. Planned for deployment on Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), they will increase the average speed of freight trains in India by approximately 25 km/h. Equipped with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) propulsion technology, the e-locos will also allow considerable savings in energy consumption thanks to the use of regenerative braking. \n“Alstom is very pleased to be delivering these electric locomotives to Indian Railways. The introduction of the Prima locomotives into the IR fleet demonstrates our commitment to the country. This revolutionary product which will be faster, safer and more environmentally friendly, and it will help write a new chapter for India’s sustainable mobility journey. We are immensely proud to be a partner in this,” said Ling Fang, Senior Vice President of Alstom Asia-Pacific. \nIn line with the Make-in-India mandate, all the 800 Prima locomotives are being manufactured locally. Designed at Alstom’s Engineering Centre in Bengaluru, the Prima T8 WAG-12 are being built in one of India’s largest integrated greenfield manufacturing facilities at Madhepura in Bihar. Spread across 250 acres, with a production capacity of 120 locomotives per year, the Madhepura site is built to international standards of safety and quality. Two ultra-modern maintenance depots in Saharanpur and Nagpur will ensure the high service availability of the locomotives. The Saharanpur depot is already operational and the one in Nagpur is under construction. Equipped with the latest features, these depots will play a critical role in maintaining India’s most advanced freight locomotives at significantly lower costs. \nAs part of the largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) project of Indian Railways, in 2015 the Ministry of Railways and Alstom signed a contract worth €3.5 billion (INR 25,000 crore) and created a joint venture for the project. The contract allowed for the manufacture of 800 double-section, 12000-horsepower electric locomotives for freight service and associated maintenance for a period of 11 years. The scope also included the set-up of a manufacturing plant at Madhepura (Bihar) for building the e-locos and two maintenance depots at Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh) and Nagpur (Maharashtra). A true embodiment of India’s vision, the project will create more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the country (primarily in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra).',NULL,NULL,1),(1236,'Alstom','Alstom delivers the 300th Coradia Polyvalent train, produced in Reichshoffen, to France\'s Occitanie region','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/5/alstom-delivers-300th-coradia-polyvalent-train-produced-reichshoffen','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/05/18/photo%20CP%20occitanie%201.png?itok=4Xcdegxr','19 May 2020','2023-09-20 17:31:16','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - France Great East\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Arnaud Zeisser\n      \n              Send an email,19 May 2020 – Alstom delivered the 300th Coradia Polyvalent train for Régiolis in the Occitanie region  on Thursday 7 May. After 6 years of operation, the total delivered fleet of Coradia Polyvalent trains has covered more than 107 million kilometres with a level of reliability and availability in line with the expectations of SNCF Voyageurs and the French Regions. \n“This 300th train is an important milestone for the Reichshoffen site. It symbolises Alstom\'s ability to meet the different expectations of the regions, from the same platform, thus combining industrial excellence with a tailored response to the legitimate expectations and requirements of each public transport authority,\" said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, CEO of Alstom in France.\nWith their modular architecture, the Coradia Polyvalent trains can be adapted to the requirements of each public transport authority as well as to the different types of operation - suburban, regional and intercity. The trains, which can travel at 160 km/h, are available in three lengths (56, 72 or 110 metres) and offers optimal comfort to passengers, whatever the length of the journey. Coradia Polyvalent trains are both ecological and economical thanks to their low energy consumption and reduced maintenance costs. Operation in multiple units of up to four trains makes it possible to adapt flexibly to dense traffic or peaks of up to 1,000 passengers.  \nIn response to the hydrogen plan initiated by the French Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition and the Minister for Transport in June 2018, Alstom is now proposing to incorporate a dual-mode electric-hydrogen version into the Coradia Polyvalent range. \nThe first Coradia Polyvalent trains entered commercial service in April 2014 in Aquitaine, Grand Est and Occitanie. To date, 387 trains have been ordered as part of the contract awarded to Alstom by SNCF in October 2009, including 27 cross-border trains between France and Switzerland (AURA region for LEMAN Express), and 30 cross-border trains between France and Germany (Grand Est region). \nThe design and manufacture of projects stemming from the Coradia Polyvalent platform secures more than 4,000 jobs in France for Alstom and its suppliers.

Two pre-series trains of Alstom\'s Coradia iLint model have been in passenger service since September 2018.\nFrom 2022, 14 Coradia iLint series trains will replace the existing diesel multiple units. LNVG was the first company to believe in hydrogen, investing in it with the order of 14 Coradia iLint trains and thirty years of maintenance and power supply. This project showcases the importance of green mobility for the state of Lower Saxony. As one of the leading rail vehicle manufacturers in Europe, Alstom will produce the fuel cell trains for LNVG and will be responsible for the maintenance of the vehicles at its site in Salzgitter. The gases and engineering company Linde will build and operate a hydrogen filling station for the series trains near Bremervoerde station.\n\"Our two pre-series trains of the Coradia iLint have proven over the past year and a half that fuel cell technology can be used successfully in daily passenger service. This makes us an important driving force on the way to emission-free and sustainable mobility in rail transport\", comments Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director for Germany and Austria of Alstom Transport Deutschland GmbH. \"We have also obtained valuable data from the trial operation of the fuel cell trains for the further development of the propulsion technology.\"  \n“We are proud that we were the first railway company in the world to be allowed to operate the first two fuel cell trains on the Weser-Elbe network. From the very beginning, our passengers were very curious about the trains and their new propulsion technology. Besides its very low noise level, the hydrogen train was able to score with its emission-free operation, especially in times of climate change. The operation of the iLint was a very special motivation for our train drivers\", said Andreas Wagner, head of the SPNV division and authorized signatory of the Eisenbahnen und Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser GmbH (evb). \nCarmen Schwabl, Managing Director of LNVG, adds: \"With the successfully completed trial operation, the requirements for continuous operation of the hydrogen trains from 2022 are fulfilled. LNVG thus contributes to the implementation of sustainable, innovative and ecological mobility solutions, especially in rural areas\".\n\"Alstom has made hydrogen history here. The project is of a great importance to industrial policy that goes far beyond Germany. Here, we are witnessing the first competitive product of hydrogen mobility at industrial level\", says Lower Saxony\'s Minister of Economics and Transport, Dr. Bernd Althusmann.\n\"The Federal Ministry of Transport is very happy to support the beacon of modern mobility: the hydrogen train in Bremervörde. After all, this project is a flagship for the mobility of the future,\" says Enak Ferlemann, Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. \"Hydrogen is a real low-emission and efficient alternative to diesel. Especially on secondary lines where overhead lines are uneconomical or not yet available, these trains can travel cleanly and in an environmentally friendly way. We would like to see more such applications.\"\nAbout the Coradia iLint\nCoradia iLint is the first passenger train in the world to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which generates electrical energy for propulsion. This completely emission-free train is quiet and emits only water vapor and condensation water. The train features several different innovations: clean energy conversion, flexible energy storage in batteries and intelligent management of motive power and available energy.

Although considered a stabilisation year, Alstom enjoyed strong commercial momentum in a very dynamic railway market. We won major orders especially in Europe and in Asia-Pacific. In addition, we secured pioneering orders for our green mobility solutions, illustrating the potential of such technologies and the dynamism of the shift to carbon free transportation modes. The continuous improvement in our operational performance demonstrates the Group’s focus on profitable growth.\nThe end of the fiscal year was marked by the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis. Alstom considers the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders as its top priority during this period. We are confident for the resilience of Alstom’s business in the mid-term, given the fundamentals of the rail market and in particular, the need for greener mobility.” said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n***\nCovid-19 impact and Alstom response\nAlstom responded to the crisis caused by the outbreak of Covid-19 by making the health and safety protection of its employees the priority and deploying measures in compliance with guidance from local and international authorities. \nThe containment resulted in the reduction of activities in most production and maintenance facilities as from the end of the 2019/20 fiscal year. The impact on Alstom\'s sales in this fiscal year 2019/20 is assessed to be c.€100 million, mostly on rolling stock due to the slowdown of sales recognition during the containment period, and to a lesser extent on services due to train traffic reduction. The identified inefficiencies and incremental costs impacting the cost of sales represent €24 million in fiscal year 2019/20.\nThe Group has organized itself by putting in place crisis cells at all levels of the organization in order to deal with this unprecedented situation. To mitigate the impact of the temporary reduction of activities while keeping the capabilities to deliver its €40.9 billion backlog, the Group resorted to holiday and part-time work schemes starting March when regulations allow. A comprehensive operational, commercial, cost and cash mitigation plan has been defined and is being implemented. Alstom has started to slowly re-open most of its sites from end of April onwards when the necessary safety conditions were met, with progressive alignment with supply chain needed before partial restart of production early May. In addition, impact on commercial activities and market development is being closely monitored, with a potential delay on tenders. \nIn addition, on top of its already available substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €2,175 million as of 31 March 2020, and of its undrawn €400 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), Alstom has taken additional actions to bolster its liquidity in the context of Covid-19. It secured in April 2020 a €1,750 million short term RCF with a 1-year maturity, a 6-month extension option at the borrower’s discretion and another 6-month extension at the lenders’ discretion. Liquidity resources stand at €2,575 million as of 31 March 2020 comprising €2,175 million in available cash and cash equivalents and €400 million of fully undrawn credit lines plus the additional €1,750 million under the new short term RCF put in place in April 2020. \nBeyond these internal measures, Alstom teams have been committed throughout the world to support the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, for example by leveraging 3D technology to produce face shields and valves for respirators, and donating masks and other protective equipment to hospitals, local communities and suppliers. Alstom Foundation’s budget will also increase from €1.5 to €1.9 million euros in 2020/21, partially funded by a decrease of the CEO and executive committee members’ remuneration this quarter.\nStrategic and business update \nThis fiscal year 2019/20 is the first year of the Alstom in Motion strategy (AiM) announced by Alstom on June 24 2019, which sets a clear ambition: be the leading global innovative player for a sustainable and smart mobility by 2025. The Group is already progressing on the AiM priorities:\n1. Growth by offering greater value to our customers\nThe Group booked €9,900 million of orders in the fiscal year 2019/20. This compares to the exceptional performance of €12,107 million orders last year, which included Avelia HorizonTM for SNCF and Montreal metro orders totalling €4.3 billion. The book-to-bill ratio was strong at 1.2.\nAlstom was awarded projects in both Urban and Mainlines segments mainly in Europe, notably additional very high speed trains in France, the renewal of metros of the Ile-de-France region and regional trains in Germany, including an order for iLintTMhydrogen trains, and in Asia Pacific with a combined supply of suburban trains and associated maintenance in Perth, Australia and the Sydney metro extension. \nIn line with its AiM strategy, Alstom enjoyed an increase in orders in both Services and Signalling, which total 51% of the Group’s order intake in the fiscal year 2019/20. In Services, Alstom was awarded the 7-year contract to refurbish and maintain PendolinoTM for Avanti West Coast in the United Kingdom, the maintenance of lines 2 and 4 of the Santiago metro in Chile, as well as the maintenance operations associated with Rolling Stock orders in Perth, Australia and in Germany. In Signalling, commercial successes include the supply of ERTMS[1] to the Paris-Lyon high-speed line, equipping 77 trains in Sweden with ERTMS onboard solutions, the automation of the Marseille metro as well as a service partnership for driverless train control system for the Circle Line in Singapore. \nAlstom’s backlog amounted to €40,903 million on 31 March 2020, providing strong visibility on future sales and representing the leading backlog in the industry.\nIn the fiscal year 2019/20, Alstom’s total sales reached €8,201 million, up 2% (1% organically). \nAlthough manufacturing activity was impacted by Covid-19 containment measures during the last two weeks of the fiscal year, Rolling Stock sales reached €3,942 million (+14% organic) thanks to the sound execution of large high-speed and regional projects in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as very high speed in the United States. Both Signalling and Services sales amounted to 36% of Alstom sales with Signalling up by +13% organically at €1,489 million, mainly benefiting from on-going projects in India, Europe and AMECA region. Services sales reached €1,469 million, down moderately by 6% organically, due to fully traded contracts in the United States and one-off events last year in the UK, partially offset by other maintenance contracts ramp-up. In addition, services activities were slightly impacted at the end of the fiscal year with reduction of fleet utilisation following containment measures. Systems sales decreased to €1,301 million with an expected ramp-down on Dubai, Lusail and Riyadh systems projects and a fully delivered contract in Panama.\n2. Innovation in smarter and greener mobility solutions\nAlstom sustained its level of research and development (net costs) at €302 million, i.e. 3.7% of sales, for fiscal year 2019/20. \nAlstom strengthened its position as a leading actor in providing comprehensive alternative solutions to diesel pushing towards carbon neutrality. Alstom showed strong commercial momentum for green mobility solutions and now offers all types of traction systems on the market, as well as the full range of emission-free drives, from efficient electric motors to hydrogen fuel-cells and advanced battery traction. Alstom was awarded a second large order in Germany for its Coradia iLintTM hydrogen train, leading to a total of 41 sold trains and the completion of successful tests in Netherlands. In addition, Alstom was awarded its first contract for battery-electric regional trains in Germany for a total of 11 CoradiaTM Continental electric regional trains in order to bridge the 80 kilometres of non-electrified line between the cities of Chemnitz and Leipzig. The new AptisTM electric bus has also been sold to five French cities (Paris, La Rochelle, Toulon, Strasbourg and Grenoble) with the first delivery made in January 2020 in Strasbourg, and first commercial success in Spain.  \nFacing mobility evolutions, transport operators are increasingly looking for digital solutions to improve their financial and operational performance. Aware of this trend, Alstom provided a predictive analytics solution to Panama metro operators which improved the “fail to board” by +30% during peak hours thanks to artificial intelligence. In addition, Alstom finalized the co-development of a railway system simulator with the start-up Cosmotech which enables, in tender phase, to simulate energy efficiency and punctuality of a metro system.    \nIn September 2019, a new version of Alstom’s Atlas™ European Train Control System (ETCS) has entered service on the Wuppertal suspension railway (“Wuppertaler Schwebebahn”) in Germany. This project represents the very first application of ERTMS Level 3 in which train location and integrity are solely supervised by the ETCS equipment onboard the train, hence sparing wayside equipment. It consolidates Alstom’s position as a leading player in digital signalling. \n3. Efficiency powered by digital\nIn the fiscal year 2019/20 Alstom’s adjusted EBIT reached €630 million, equivalent to an adjusted EBIT margin of 7.7%, as compared to €606 million and 7.5% in the previous fiscal year. The improved operational performance was driven by an increase in revenue combined with industrial efficiency.\nIn line with AiM efficiency strategy, Alstom moved forward during this year in its business process digitization roadmap with 80% of the group turnover being covered by a group core model SAP solution. The Covid-19 containment measures also showed the digital agility and resiliency of the Group: within a few days, thousands of engineers were able to access very demanding software solutions from home ensuring quasi-complete continuity of engineering.\nAlstom is enlarging its Best Cost Country and regional footprint, with the inauguration of its Alstom Ubunye factory in South Africa in October 2019. A significant investment has been made in upskilling employees and installing state-of-the-art equipment such as advanced robot technology. Through the modernisation of Alstom Ubunye, Alstom has established an African rail company with local partners, creating a stronger industrial and commercial base and preparing to serve the increasing demand for rail innovation in Africa. \nFinally, Alstom accelerated its Engineering footprint optimisation with 24% of the Engineering workload executed in India in 2019/20, compared to a 30% objective for 2022/23. \nNet Income from continued operations (group share) reached €446 million compared to €433 million the previous year, which had several one-off items, of which €106 million linked to the General Electric joint venture transaction.\nEarnings per share from continued operations reached €1.99 in fiscal year 2019/20.\n4. One Alstom team, agile, inclusive and responsible \nGreen and smart mobility, encouraged by customer and passenger expectations, is leading to a transformation of the market. Already recognised as an industrial reference in this domain, Alstom’s mission is to support the transition towards sustainable transport systems by offering innovative solutions that are efficient throughout their entire life cycle. \nAs part of its climate strategy, Alstom has continued to progress in achieving its environmental targets set as part of the AiM strategy:\nOn the way to reaching 25% reduction of energy consumption in its solutions by 2025[2], Alstom progressed to 20% as of March 2020 (compared to 17% last year),\nAlstom has increased its newly developed solutions with eco-design to 25% in March 2020, with the objective to reach 100% in 2025,\nFinally, Alstom secured 36% share of electricity from renewable sources in its operations, with a target to reach 100% by 2025.\nIn addition, Alstom is focused on the implementation of its AiM initiatives related to corporate social responsibility, and has been attributed three important recognitions during the fiscal year 2019/20:\nIn June 2019, after becoming the first French company to obtain the AFAQ ISO 37001 Anti-bribery certification for France and Europe in 2017, followed by Asia-Pacific in 2018, Alstom obtained certification for its countries of operation in the regions of North America, Middle East & Africa and Latin America.\nIn September 2019, Alstom was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) World and Europe for the ninth consecutive year and is now in the 4th percentile of the ranking, attesting to its leading position in sustainable business practices.\nIn January 2020, Alstom was certified as a Top Employer Europe by the Top Employers Institute in six countries: France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Belgium and UK.\n***\nBombardier acquisition update and indicative timetable\nAlstom announced on February 17, 2020 that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Bombardier Inc. and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) in view of the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation. \nAlstom\'s unions indicated they will render their opinion around summer 2020 on the proposed takeover of Bombardier Transportation, according to the “method agreement” reached with management. An EGM vote on the reserved capital increases to CDPQ and Bombardier Inc. and the rights issue should take place no later than October 31, 2020. Subject to the EGM approval, rights issue will take place between the second semester 2020 and first semester 2021, subject to market conditions, and the reserved capital increases will take place at closing. The syndication of €2.4 billion of Bridge Facilities and a new €1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility related to the proposed acquisition of Bombardier was completed in April 2020 as planned. The transaction will also be subject to clearance from relevant regulatory authorities and anti-trust authorities. Closing is expected in the first half of 2021.\n***\nSolid balance sheet\nDuring the fiscal year 2019/20, the Group free cash flow was positive at €206 million, impacted as expected by an increase in inventories resulting from the ramp up of large Rolling Stock projects and benefiting from solid project execution and delivery. \nThe Group had available cash and cash equivalents amounting to €2,175 million as of 31 March 2020. Alstom bond debt amounted to €700m as end of March 2020 after having successfully carried out the issuance of a 7-year €700 million senior unsecured Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 0.25% and reimbursed at maturity a €596 million bond as end of March 2020 and a €283 million bond as end of July 2019.\nIn April 2020, Alstom secured a €1,750 million short term Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a 1-year maturity, a 6-month extension option at the borrower’s discretion and another 6-month extension at the lenders’ discretion. This additional RCF aims at stepping in for Alstom’s €1 billion Negotiable European Commercial Paper programme, should the Commercial Papers market no longer be accessible, in addition to providing an extra liquidity buffer.\nThese actions substantially bolster the Company’s already strong liquidity in the context of Covid-19. Liquidity resources stand at €2,575 million as of 31 March 2020 comprising €2,175 million in available cash and cash equivalents and €400 million of fully undrawn credit lines plus the additional €1,750 million under the new short term RCF put in place in April 2020.\nAlstom net cash amounted to €1,178 million on 31 March 2020, compared to €2,325 million on 31 March 2019. Finally, equity stood at €3,328 million at 31 March 2020, compared to €4,159 million on 31 March 2019, in particular as a result of the dividend distribution in July 2019.\n***\nDividend \nIn the context of the current crisis, and in a spirit of responsibility towards all its stakeholders, the Board of Directors, in its meeting of May 11, 2020, decided as an exceptional measure not to propose a dividend distribution at the next Shareholders’ meeting on July 8.\nAlstom would like to point out, however, that this decision is not due to a lack of liquidity. \n ***\nOutlook in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic\nIn 2019/20, Alstom has fully deployed its Alstom in Motion (AiM) strategic plan in order to progressively deliver revenues and margin growth in line with the objectives set in the context of AiM for 2022/23.\nHowever, the Covid-19 crisis is likely to affect negatively the financial performance of the fiscal year 2020/21, including order intake, net income, free cash flow and sales, though it is not possible today to assess precisely its impact. \nWhile a partial restart of production is on-going as of May 12, the Group cannot predict the shape and timing of a recovery during 2020/21 as it depends on the further development of the Covid-19 crisis, the duration of containment measures and the intensity of the economic downturn and market response. After the current crisis, the Group expects a fast recovery of the rail market, sustained by strong fundamentals and the increasing demand for sustainable mobility.\nIn this context, the objective of a 5% average annual growth rate over the period 2019/20-2022/23 should be slightly impacted by the temporary slowdown of tender activity, yet the 2022/23 objectives of 9% aEBIT margin and of a conversion from net income to free cash flow above 80% are confirmed.\nWith a strong liquidity position, a demonstrated ability to deliver execution and profitability and the rapid launch of a cost and cash mitigation plan, the Group is confident in its capacity to weather the crisis as well as to capture opportunities in a resilient rail market and contribute to the transition towards sustainable transport systems.\nThe management report and the consolidated financial statements, as approved by the Board of Directors, in its meeting held on 11 May 2020, are available on Alstom’s website at www.alstom.com. These financial statements were audited by the Statutory Auditors whose certification report is in the process of being issued. \nIn accordance with AFEP-MEDEF recommendations, information related to the remuneration of Alstom‘s Executive Officer is available on Alstom’s website: www.alstom.com, under About us/Corporate Governance/Compensation of Executive Officers. \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements which are based on current plans and forecasts of Alstom’s management.

Annual amortization related to the new right-of-use asset amounts to €92 million for the year ended 31 March 2020. The total impact of the IFRS16 lease implementation to the Free Cash Flow reported aggregate is estimated at €84 million over the period (refer to note 2.2.1 “IFRS16 Lease”)\nAPPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS\nThis section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.\nOrders received\nA new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. \nWhen this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value.\nIf the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.\nOrder backlog\nOrder backlog represents sales not yet recognised from orders already received. Order backlog at the end of a financial year is computed as follows:\norder backlog at the beginning of the year;\nplus new orders received during the year;\nless cancellations of orders recorded during the year;\nless sales recognised during the year.\nThe order backlog is also subject to changes in the scope of consolidation, contract price adjustments and foreign currency translation effects.\nOrder backlog corresponds to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, as per IFRS 15 quantitative and qualitative disclosures requirement.\nBook-to-Bill \nThe book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period \nAdjusted EBIT\nWhen Alstom’s new organisation was implemented in 2015, adjusted EBIT (“aEBIT”) became the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors. \nStarting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities), namely the CASCO Joint Venture. The company believes that bringing visibility over a key contributor to the Alstom signalling strategy will provide a fairer and more accurate picture of the overall commercial & operational performance of the Group. This change will also enable more comparability with what similar market players define as being part of their main non-GAAP ‘profit’ aggregate disclosure.\naEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements: \nnet restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs);\ntangibles and intangibles impairment;\ncapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;\nany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business;\nand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments.\nA non-recurring item is a “one-off” exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.\nAdjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT in percentage of sales.\nThe non-GAAP measure adjusted EBIT (aEBIT hereafter) indicator reconciles with the GAAP measure EBIT as follows:\n\n \n\n\nFull-Year ended \n\n\nFull-year ended\n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\n31 March 2019**\n\n\n31 March 2020\n\n\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (aEBIT)*\n\n\n606\n\n\n630\n\n\nCapital gains / (losses) on disposal of business\n\n\n60\n\n\n-\n\n\nRestructuring costs\n\n\n(65)\n\n\n(18)\n\n\nImpairment loss and other\n\n\n(158)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nCovid-19 inefficiencies and incremental costs\n\n\n-\n\n\n(24)\n\n\nCASCO contribution reversal\n\n\n(36)\n\n\n(38)\n\n\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)\n\n\n408\n\n\n545\n\n*aEBIT adjusted for CASCO contribution in both periods\n** Previous year figures have not been restated to reflect the application of IFRS 16\nFree cash flow\nFree cash ﬂow is deﬁned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. In particular, free cash ﬂow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.\nThe most directly comparable financial measure to free cash flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities. \nA reconciliation of free cash ﬂow and net cash provided by operating activities is presented below:\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\nFY 2018/19*\n \n\n\nFY 2019/20\n\n\nNet cash provided by / (used in) operating activities\n\n\n425\n\n\n476\n\n\nCapital expenditure (including capitalised R&D costs)\n\n\n(275)\n\n\n(274)\n\n\nProceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\nFree cash flow\n\n\n153\n\n\n206\n\n* Previous year figures have not been restated to reflect the application of IFRS 16\nAlstom uses the free cash ﬂow both for internal analysis purposes as well as for external communication as the Group believes it provides accurate insight regarding the actual amount of cash generated or used by operations.\nNet cash/(debt)\nThe net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, other current financial assets and non-current financial assets directly associated to liabilities included in financial debt, less financial debt. \n\n \n\n\nYear ended\n\n\nYear ended\n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\n31 March 2019\n\n\n31 March 2020\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n3,432\n\n\n2,175\n\n\nOther current financial assets\n\n\n10\n\n\n45\n\n\nFinancial non-current assets directly associated to financial debt\n\n\n201\n\n\n-\n\n\nLess:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCurrent financial debt\n\n\n1,032\n\n\n270\n\n\nNon-current financial debt\n\n\n286\n\n\n772\n\n\nNet cash/(debt) at the end of the period\n\n\n2,325\n\n\n1,178\n\nDue to IFRS 16 implementation at 1 April 2019, the Group has chosen to exclude lease obligations from the net cash/(debt) which results in a change in net cash/(debt) of €(15)m at IFRS 16 first application. From 1 April 2019, the net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings. Previous year figures have not been restated to reflect the application of IFRS 16.

It is the country’s first such system and the first instance of Hesop being provided as a standalone product operating in full conversion mode. \nHesop is installed in the Rauhes Haus station on the U2 line of the city’s metro network. Capturing 99% of the braking energy, it redirects it for use within the passenger station and returns any excess to the grid. \n“Hesop is one of our responses to operators’ need for increased energy efficiency. We are proud to have introduced the system to Germany. It is an important element of the clean, efficient public transportation of the future, offering unique economic and environmental benefits,” says Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director of Alstom in Germany and Austria.\nHesop is the most powerful energy converter in the market and provides an innovative solution to the increasing energy demands of public transportation while making the overall system more sustainable. With this provision of Hesop as a standalone product, Alstom demonstrates its ability to offer flexible and varied product packages that meet the unique requirements of individual operators.\nAlstom and Hamburger Hochbahn AG signed a letter-of-intent to test Hesop in September 2018. The order was delivered in 2019. The system is developed and manufactured at Alstom\'s site of Charleroi in Belgium, while the site of Saint-Ouen in France is responsible for the system design.\nHesop is an advanced reversible power substation which both supplies traction voltage to a network and recovers braking energy from vehicles. Thanks to its wide range of voltage and power configurations, 125 units of Hesop have already been installed or ordered by a multitude of different networks: from metros in Milan, Riyadh, London, Dubai and Panama to tramways in Sydney and Milan.',NULL,NULL,1),(1241,'Alstom','Beyond mobility: Team Alstom joining the fight against the coronavirus','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/4/beyond-mobility-team-alstom-joining-fight-against-coronavirus','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/04/08/5e8dee2707af1.png?itok=UC7MoZ6T','08 Apr 2020','2023-09-20 17:31:41','During a global crisis like COVID-19, everyone can make a difference. For businesses, it is a time to prove what they stand for both to their employees and to the public. Learn about some of Alstom’s contributions and how they have helped local communities.\nWith shared mobility being distinctly different from medical science, it may not be obvious at first how companies such as Alstom can contribute during a global pandemic. However, the trains and systems that Alstom provides have become essential, transporting people to and from their essential jobs in healthcare, for instance. Or carrying patients between hospitals across the country, or for freight deliveries for shops and supermarkets, to name some obvious examples. At the same time, Alstom has ensured safe working conditions for its employees committed to delivering and maintaining these systems and services.\nBut Alstom’s contribution has not been limited to the mobility sector. To meet the unprecedented challenge that COVID-19 presents, a vast number of social responsibility initiatives have spontaneously emerged from among employees, sites and countries, illustrating a spirit of international solidarity and ingenuity in the face of a crisis. \nMany of our sites have been able to provide help to healthcare professionals through the donation of resources and equipment. Some sites have provided protective equipment such as disposable gloves, hydroalcoholic gel, integral antiviral suits, glasses, goggles and eye shields. French industrial sites have given over 70,000 masks to local hospitals, along with numerous other supplies essential for antiviral protection. \nMajor contributions have also been made by our sites through financial support to medical facilities. In many cases, this means simply collecting funds for local hospitals. Alstom teams in Italy have donated 8,000 euros to the hospital of Milan, the city most affected by the virus in the country. Our Belgian teams have put forward an important contribution to buy an artificial respirator and protective equipment  for the Charleroi hospital. \nOne of the most innovative projects has been started by the Smart Operations industrial teams in Barcelona  and Saint-Ouen: using 3D technology and expertise for producing face shields and valves for respirators. The nature of this initiative allowed it to be replicated on any site around the world where 3D printers were available: this was the case for Tarbes and La Rochelle (France), Katowice (Poland), Hornell (US) and Los Hornos (Argentina) to name a few, with other sites preparing to join the game soon. Beyond that, employees who have a 3D printer at home are invited to join in. \nThere have also been initiatives aiming to assist groups of people other than the healthcare workers. Our Chinese teams focused on helping the frontline workers in transportation: around 15,000 masks have been distributed to operators and drivers of metro trains. United Arab Emirates teams have collected 10,000 AED (2,500 euros) in order to provide grocery vouchers and multivitamins to underprivileged local families. \nIn many countries, our employees have launched personal initiatives such as donations or volunteering activities. In the UK, as a part of a national effort to support the National Health Service (NHS), Alstom employees were invited to help to people in isolation: either by supporting them in purchasing medicine and food, or remotely through holding telephone conversations. In Spain, 20 volunteers will also take part in Fundacion Addeco support program through phone calls with vulnerable people.\nAlstom’s role in helping communities with COVID-19 goes beyond these few actions described, and it continues to grow. In this spirit, Barry Howe, Community Investment Director, encouraged local CSR teams to use their remaining 2019/20 budget on coronavirus-related actions, such as support of charities, associations, NGOs involved in the fight against this global health emergency. \nIt\'s in times of crisis that good leaders emerge. Alstom is immensely proud of how its teams have responded to this challenge, and encourages everyone, both within Alstom and without, to contribute in whatever way they can, no matter how big or small.',NULL,NULL,1),(1242,'Alstom','Alstom 3D printing hub in Barcelona committed to the fight against COVID 19','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/3/alstom-3d-printing-hub-barcelona-committed-fight-against-covid-19','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/03/30/PLAFON%20ABRIDOR%204.png?itok=0YaTdvSS','30 Mar 2020','2023-09-20 17:31:49','Press contact - Spain and Portugal\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Irma Aguado \n      \n              Send an email,Production and development of new solutions for hospitals\n30 March 2020 - Alstom’s 3D printing hub in Barcelona is coordinating initiatives being implemented at a Group level to contribute to the fight against the COVID 19 global pandemic.

With this signature, the historical and world heritage city of Aranjuez will become the first municipality in the Community of Madrid (not considering the capital) to incorporate a 100% high capacity electric vehicle into the Consorcio Regional de Tramportes de la Comunidad de Madrid (Madrid Regional mobility services Consortium).\nContract signature follows a several-days-test in which the bus, manufactured by Alstom, has demonstrated its adaptability, efficiency and perfect integration in the urban environment and within the rest of the operator\'s fleet. The Madrid regional operator CRT (Consorcio Regional de Transportes) expects Aptis to enter into service on one of the lines running through the historic centre of the town before the end of the year.\n“This is the first commercial success of Aptis in Spain, which we hope to be followed by others throughout this year. During the tests carried out in different Spanish cities, our innovative electric bus has generated great expectation both among operators and among users. This contract constitutes a major new step for Alstom, which aims to be the most innovative world actor for sustainable, smart mobility”, highlights Antonio Moreno, Alstom in Spain Managing Director.\n“Mobility in the 21st century is sustainable, or it will not be. That is why I am convinced that this first experience will continue. Not only for environmental reasons but, also, because it is a real opportunity to evolve towards a more efficient, sustainable, comfortable and attractive public transport that contributes to decongesting streets and roads said the Minister of Transportation, Mobility and Infrastructures of the Community of Madrid, Ángel Garrido.\nAptis is 100% electric, so in addition to decarbonising and protecting the environment, it takes care of the architecture and monuments of Aranjuez, an Unesco World Heritage Site.\n \nThanks to its innovative design, Aptis offers an unparalleled passenger experience. Its berthing system for perfect alignment with the pavement, its low, completely flat floor and wide double doors allow easy movement and convenient boarding for people with reduced mobility and prams. Equipped with large bay windows along its entire length, Aptis offers 25% more glass surface area than a standard bus and a rear seating area with panoramic views of the city. With a length of 12 metres and equipped with 3 doors, Aptis has capacity for over 100 passengers, including 2 PMR. \nWith a range of more than 200 km, the vehicles requested by AISA is designed for charging at night at the depot. Aptis is also available for occasional recharging at the end of each line, using either ground-based charging solutions (SRS) or pantograph charging. \nAptis was designed to have an optimised total cost. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of standard buses. The aim for local authorities, therefore, is to have a total cost equivalent to that of existing standard diesel buses.\nFirst serial Aptis units, presented at last Busworld edition, are currently entering in commercial operation in Strasburg. Aptis has been also chosen by RATP and Île-de-France Mobilités, and by the areas of Greater Grenoble, Greater La Rochelle, and Greater Toulon, where commercial operations are due this year.',NULL,NULL,1),(1246,'Alstom','Alstom’s hydrogen train Coradia iLint completes successful tests in the Netherlands','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/3/alstoms-hydrogen-train-coradia-ilint-completes-successful-tests','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/03/06/Coradia_iLint2018_%20Copyright%20%20R.%20Frampe%20_MR-1.jpg?itok=I-eNZ_oI','06 Mar 2020','2023-09-20 17:32:06','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - Belgium - Luxemburg- Netherlands\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Sonia Thibaut \n      \n              Send an email,The world’s first hydrogen fuel cell passenger train takes its first steps abroad after commercial success in Germany\n6 March 2020 – Alstom has performed ten days of tests of the Coradia iLint hydrogen fuel cell train on the 65 kilometres of line between Groningen and Leeuwarden in the north of the Netherlands. The tests follow 18 successful months of passenger service on the Buxtehude–Bremervörde–Bremerhaven–Cuxhaven line in Germany, where total of 41 Coradia iLint have already been ordered. The latest tests make the Netherlands the second country in Europe where the train has proven itself a unique emissions-free solution for non-electrified lines.\nLast October, Alstom and the Province of Groningen, local operator Arriva, the Dutch railway infrastructure manager ProRail and the energy company Engie signed a pilot project agreement to test the Coradia iLint, the world’s first passenger train powered by hydrogen fuel cells, in the Netherlands. DEKRA, an independent testing inspection and certification company, has been appointed test leader. This series of tests is being performed at night at up to 140 km/h without passengers. For the purpose of the tests, a mobile filling station has been erected by Engie for refuelling the Coradia iLint with completely green – sustainably produced – hydrogen. \n“The tests in the Netherlands demonstrate how our hydrogen train is mature in terms of availability and reliability, providing the same performance as traditional regional trains, but with the benefit of low noise and zero emissions. It is also easy to integrate in an existing fleet and is compliant with all safety regulations. The Coradia iLint hydrogen train is a reliable emission-free train ready to help transport us to a carbon-neutral Europe,” said Bernard Belvaux, Managing Director, Alstom Benelux.  \nThe Coradia iLint is the world\'s first regional passenger train to enter service equipped with fuel cells to convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, thus eliminating pollutant emissions related to propulsion.

Alstom’s share of contract amounts to more than €120 million. The contract was signed by CFR SA, the Romanian state rail carrier, and the Asocierea RailWorks consortium[1], which Alstom is leading. The project is expected to last four years.  \nThe work will take place on the subsection Sighisoara-Brasov, part of the European Rhine-Danube Corridor, which links Nuremberg-Prague-Vienna-Budapest-Curtici-Simeria-Brasov-Bucharest-Constanta. Alstom has been active in ongoing rehabilitation works on the Romanian part of this corridor since 2012. \nThe contract covers the modernisation of approximately 170 kilometres of railway infrastructure for passenger trains operating at up to 160 km/h. It includes infrastructure and superstructure rehabilitation, electrification, signalling and telecommunication systems, including GSM-R, as well as civil works. Alstom is directly responsible for the implementation of a traffic control centre in the city of Brasov, the digital interlocking and ERTMS Level 2 deployment, passenger information systems and catenary upgrades and electric traction substations.\n“This contract reaffirms Alstom\'s leading position on the Romanian railway market, for both digital train control and electrification. After installing the first modern traffic management system in Romania, we are now ready to extend such high-level performance to the new sections. This project will be another strong reference for Alstom. Bucharest has become a strategic hub for Alstom’s train control expertise, not just for local projects, but also the rest of central and eastern Europe,” explains Gabriel Stanciu, Alstom Managing Director for Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova. \nAlstom is a global pioneer in the development and implementation of on-board digital train control equipment. ATLAS 200 is Alstom’s ERTMS level 2 solution allowing trains to run at higher speeds without physical lineside signals. Alstom will also deliver the traffic management system for the train control centre and implement the GSM-R telecommunications system.\nFor the upgrade of the catenary systems, Alstom will supply its OCS3 catenary solution for main lines, leveraging its inhouse capabilities at the manufacturing facility in Lecco, Italy, and its worldwide experience of OCS3 in commercial operation. \nAlstom has been present in Romania for over 25 years and currently employs 450 people in the country. The company’s ongoing activities include railway rehabilitation projects in various phases of implementation, as well as the maintenance of Bucharest metro trains.\n[1] Asocierea RailWorks consortium consists of consortium leader Alstom and three companies providing civil and rail works: Aktor, Arcada and Euroconstruct.',NULL,NULL,1),(1248,'Alstom','Alstom to supply 17 additional Citadis trams to the Eurometropole of Strasbourg','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/3/alstom-supply-17-additional-citadis-trams-eurometropole-strasbourg','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/03/03/MG_0739.jpg?itok=T1M0q9t1','03 Mar 2020','2023-09-20 17:32:13','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - France Great East\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Arnaud Zeisser\n      \n              Send an email,3 March 2020 – Alstom will supply 17 additional Citadis trams to the Strasbourg Transport Company (CTS) and the Eurometropole of Strasbourg for the sum of €52 million.

The city now has one of the largest tram fleets in France, having been ordered in four tranches beginning in 2000 and beginning passenger service in 2003.\nThis fleet consists of 118 trams of 44 metres in length and 12 trams of 33 metres. Each tram can accommodate between 218 and 300 passengers, the equivalent of more than three buses. Alstom\'s Citadis trams offer optimal on-board travel quality with a full low floor, air conditioning and a video-protection system, as well as audio and visual information. Up to 98% recyclable, Citadis trams help to preserve the environment.\nThe Bordeaux tram network consists of four lines, with a total length of 77 kilometres. 35 kilometres are equipped with the APS ground-level power supply technology. The Citadis trams are well loved by the city’s inhabitants, who appreciate their accessibility and acknowledge that they have transformed the urban landscape. The Bordeaux tram network is one of the busiest in France, carrying more than 100 million passengers per year.\n\"The celebration of this delivery is a proud moment for the Alstom teams and for me, as it brings the fleet of Citadis trams in Bordeaux Métropole up to 130 and bears witness to the trust our customer has placed in us over the past 20 years,” said François Papin, Director of Alstom\'s site at La Rochelle, Alstom\'s centre of excellence for trams.\nAll the Citadis trams (33 and 44 metres) of Bordeaux Métropole are equipped to be compatible with the APS system, which has since been implemented on numerous tram systems, including those of Reims, Tours, Dubai, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro.\nBordeaux Métropole was the first customer to place its trust in Alstom\'s new power supply solutions, which represent an alternative to conventional catenary power supply. As well as APS, new technological innovations are available to reduce energy consumption and preserve city centres: SRS, an innovative ground-based static recharging system, Citadis Ecopack, and battery solutions.   \nThe Bordeaux trams were manufactured at seven Alstom sites in France: La Rochelle for the design and assembly, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction system equipment, Villeurbanne for the on-board electronics, Vitrolles for the APS and Saint-Ouen for the design.\nIn total, more than 2,500 Citadis trams have been sold to more than 50 cities throughout 20 countries.',NULL,NULL,1),(1254,'Alstom','Alstom signs first contract for battery-electric regional trains in Germany','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/2/alstom-signs-first-contract-battery-electric-regional-trains-germany','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/02/04/Coradia_Continental_Copyright%20Design%20Styling.jpg?itok=o6zoggFJ','05 Feb 2020','2023-09-20 17:32:50','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,A complete range of emission-free traction drives\n5 February 2020 – Alstom will manufacture, deliver and maintain until 2032 eleven Coradia Continental battery-electric trains for regional traffic on the Leipzig-Chemnitz route on behalf of VMS (Verkehrsverbund Mittelsachsen) and with the support of ZVNL (Zweckverband für den Nahverkehrsraum Leipzig), the two authorities responsible for this line. The contract is worth approximately €100 million. Following this order, Alstom offers all types of traction systems on the market as well as the full range of emission-free drives, from efficient electric motors to hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery traction. \nIn 2014, Alstom had previously signed a contract with VMS for the delivery of 29 Coradia Continental electric regional trains (EMU). In order to bridge the 80 kilometres of non-electrified line between the cities of Chemnitz and Leipzig, the authority requested a battery-electric version (BEMU). The new trains will enter service in 2023. They will be built at Alstom\'s German site of Salzgitter, in Lower Saxony. The battery traction sub-system is designed and supplied by Alstom’s traction centre of excellence in Tarbes.\n“We are immensely proud to be providing the responsible authorities with a sustainable and perfectly-suited solution. Today, Alstom stands apart in being able to offer any form of emission-free traction currently on the market built into a proven solution. As a responsible company, Alstom has an intense focus on sustainable mobility, offering the best-fitting solutions that make it not only possible, but also cost-effective and attractive,” says Gian Luca Erbacci, Senior Vice President of Alstom Europe. \nThe Coradia Continental BEMU trains will be similar to those already in service on the Dresden, Riesa and Zwickau routes. The main difference: they will also have high-performance batteries on the roof. The train, based on the proven Coradia Continental, builds on Alstom’s long experience in battery traction, gained with the Coradia iLint, Citadis trams and the Prima H3 locomotive. \nThe Coradia Continental BEMU has a range of up to 120 kilometres and can be operated under catenary as well as on non-electrified sections. The three-car-trains will be 56 metres long and equipped with 150 seats. They will have a top speed of 160 km/h in battery mode. The capacity of the batteries (high-power lithium-ion) is calculated to ensure catenary-free operation of the line Chemnitz-Leipzig without any sacrifice in performance or comfort. \nAlstom’s Coradia range allows operators and transport authorities to offer their passengers regional trains that meet their needs and expectations, while demonstrating exemplary reliability and cost-effectiveness. Alstom has tailored the Coradia range to operate with all available emission-free power systems, from electric to battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cells. The latter, the Coradia iLint, powered by fuel cells and offering performance comparable to a diesel train while emitting nothing but water, has been in passenger service in Germany for over a year.',NULL,NULL,1),(1255,'Alstom','World Premiere: Alstom delivers its first series electric bus to Strasbourg','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/world-premiere-alstom-delivers-its-first-series-electric-bus-strasbourg','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/01/31/Aptis_CTS_Copyright_CTS%20%282%29.jpg?itok=YjKJofOm','31 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:32:54','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,31 January 2020 – Alstom is delivering the very first 100% electric Aptis bus to Strasbourg transport operator Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois (CTS). This constitutes a major new step for Alstom, which aims to be the most innovative world actor for sustainable, smart mobility. Following the groundbreaking delivery, CTS will train 150 drivers in the operation of the new vehicles. During this initial training phase, the bus will run on the streets of Strasbourg with the livery that the Aptis fleet will adopt when in high-level service on the H line. With a length of 12 metres and equipped with 3 doors, Aptis buses were designed at the Hangenbieten Eurométropolis. They are the first electric buses to join CTS’s fleet of vehicles.\n“This is a great moment for Alstom.We are proud to be delivering the group’s first-ever bus to Strasbourg, as it was the first city to trust us, and is located only a few kilometres from our production site,” said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President of Alstom in France.\nThanks to its innovative design, Aptis offers an unparalleled passenger experience. Its berthing system for perfect alignment with the pavement, its low, completely flat floor and wide double doors allow easy movement and convenient boarding for people with reduced mobility and prams. Equipped with large bay windows along its entire length, Aptis offers 25% more glass surface area than a standard bus and a rear seating area with panoramic views of the city.\nThe vehicles requested by the city of Strasbourg are designed for slow charging at night at the depot. Aptis is also available for occasional recharging at the end of each line, using either ground-based charging solutions (SRS) or pantograph charging. Aptis was designed to have an optimised total cost. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of standard buses. The aim for local authorities, therefore, is to have a total cost equivalent to that of existing standard diesel buses.\nAptis was also chosen by RATP and Île-de-France Mobilités, and by the areas of Greater Grenoble, Greater La Rochelle, and Greater Toulon, where commercial operations are due this year. As of September 2018, Aptis is also referenced by the CATP for public purchasing by local authorities. This referencing allows member authorities to order Aptis vehicles directly and simply from the CATP without having to embark on long and costly procedures.\nAptis also received the Origine France Garantie in January 2019.

That amount equals the weight of 800 Eiffel towers.\nThrough the Plastic Beings campaign, Fundación Vivo Sano and the Alstom Foundation will carry set of activities in schools of the Community of Madrid, and in Alstom sites in Madrid and Barcelona. The program includes talks, awareness focus groups, creative recycling workshops, and waste collection.\nThe activities in schools will be developed among students from 5th, 6th and 7th grade. Through theatrical performances and other artistic activities, these workshops will help students to reflect on current consumption models and propose their own initiatives to eradicate plastic.  In a first wave, the program will address over 500 students in 6 different schools. \n“With small actions at the individual level we can achieve great changes at the social level. The environmental problem is already well visible, but we must move towards effective solutions. For example, separating waste and recycling is not enough, because these plastics do not degrade, they do not disappear. It is necessary to eliminate plastics from our lives and opt for more sustainable materials, that would be a real contribution to the conservation of the oceans and the environment”, says environmental scientist Nuria Millán, head of the Plastic Beings campaign of the Fundación Vivo Sano .\nDuring this month of January, awareness initiatives were also initiated in Alstom Spain centres with different educational and internal sessions, both in Madrid and in Barcelona. “According to latest Eurobarometer figures, 87% of European citizens are worried about the environmental impact of plastics, but the concern is not enough, we must take action and change attitudes. Responsibility -with our employees, customers and society as a whole- is one of our corporate values. And promoting a change towards more sustainable actions, both in our internal policies and among our employees is part of our Responsibility as a company”, underlays Reyes Torres, HR director at Alstom Spain.\nIn addition to the awareness workshops, Alstom Spain employees will participate next summer in different waste collection actions both on the banks of the Manzanares river, in Madrid, and on the Mediterranean coast, in Barcelona, thanks to the cooperation of other organizations such as OMC Villaverde and Yotuba Barcelona.',NULL,NULL,1),(1260,'Alstom','Alstom at ElekBu 2020','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/alstom-elekbu-2020','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/01/Atypix%20-%20Photo%20Bus%20APTIS%20-%2001%20%28WEB%29.jpg?itok=UIQ7fBQA','28 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:33:21','Communications director Europe\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Carole Courtin\n      \n              Send an email,Alstom presents its improved Aptis e-bus at ElekBu\n28 January 2020 – Alstom will present its Aptis electric bus at ElekBu 2020, being held in Berlin from 4 to 5 February. After extensive testing in many French and European cities for the past two years, the serial design of Alstom’s innovative 100% electric mobility solution incorporates feedback from passengers and transport operators. Following test drives in major German cities such as Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, the serial 12 meters Aptis e-bus is to be shown at a roadshow in Germany this year.\nThe serial vehicles are based on an optimized global architecture requiring fewer spare parts references and considerably facilitating maintenance operations. Thanks to a wheel steering angle of more than 40°, its ease of insertion increases significantly. The 15% reduction in the total weight of the vehicle, combined with the use of new, more efficient and state of the art batteries, substantially increases range. Aptis now accommodates more passengers, with a capacity of 100 persons, while still offering them more fluidity thanks to large sliding doors. \nIn addition to the technical improvements, Aptis can also boast significant improvements to passenger comfort. A new air-conditioning system that (fully electrical heat-pump) maximises thermal comfort and the panoramic rear lounge has been enhanced to give a feeling of increased space. The new hydraulic suspension allows superior comfort and sound insulation, making Aptis one of the quietest and most innovative buses on the market. The high level of comfort is also reflected in the many very positive passenger surveys.\n\"Alstom is pleased to present the Aptis at ElekBu, which is so important for the German market. In the last two years, we have gained important experiences in trial operation. This 100% electric mobility solution offers a new experience to passengers and drivers while meeting the new mobility challenges of urban areas,\" underlines Guillaume Legoupil, Sales Director Aptis.\nAptis is particularly popular in France, where it is also built. It has already been chosen by Paris in the context of Europe’s largest call for tender for electric buses, as well as by the cities of Strasbourg, Grenoble, La Rochelle and Toulon. From February, the first series buses will be in regular service in Strasbourg.',NULL,NULL,1),(1261,'Alstom','Appointments to Alstom’s Executive Committee','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/appointments-alstoms-executive-committee','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/01/27/thumbnail%20nomination.png?itok=RjkO9O61','27 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:33:25','',NULL,NULL,1),(1262,'Alstom','Alstom Innovation Awards 2019','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/alstom-innovation-awards-2019','','22 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:33:31','Communications director Europe\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Carole Courtin\n      \n              Send an email,Team from Switzerland and Germany awarded gold medal for gauge-changeable bogie\n\n\nJanuary 22, 2020 – On 12 December 2019, a joint team from Switzerland and Germany won the gold medal in the category of “Innovative Products & Systems“. The team convinced the jury with its idea of a gauge-changeable bogie for trains.\nTrendsetting innovations were awarded for the 12th time within the scope of the company-wide innovation programme ‘I Nove You‘in France, Alstom’s headquarters. With more than 2,000 participants and a total of 620 projects submitted from 23 countries, more Alstom teams participated in 2019 than ever before.\nThe joint team from the sites of Neuhausen (Switzerland) and Salzgitter (Germany) showed this year how successful cross-border cooperation can look like. The Centre of Excellence (CoE) Regional Bogies in Salzgitter was responsible for the design and development of the gauge-enabled bogie and is also where the bogies are produced. \nThe newly developed bogie can continuously adjust its gauge from meter to standard gauge (1,435mm), thus solving the challenge of differently high platform edges and track gauges, which is the case in Switzerland. \nThis adjustment can be performed during the passage of a stationary gauge changing mechanism at a maximum speed of 15 km/h. Thanks to its flexibility, the bogie allows an efficient and cost-effective operation because its use reduces the number of necessary train configurations. Operators therefore receive reliable multifunctional bogie technology with minimum investment.\nPassengers, too, benefit from this innovative novelty. For them, this flexible bogie means fewer changeovers and therefore less time lost. The bogie is adjusted to differently high platform edges, thus ensuring a convenient and safe entry and exit. In addition, a pneumatically controlled suspension and the optimum bogie design provide a pleasant ride comfort. The competitive gauge-changing trailer bogie will mainly be used on track sections between Montreux and Interlaken in Switzerland. This innovation will help Alstom to further strengthen its pioneering position in railway technology.\nCora Hentrich-Henne, Managing Director of Alstom in Switzerland, explains the importance of the innovation programme for Alstom: “Innovation is a major part of our strategy for 2020.We are delighted that the Swiss team has been awarded for its work. The award-winning adjustable bogie was developed for the special needs and requirements of the Swiss market. With this technology, we are able to further emphasize our position as a pioneer of smarter mobility and to set ourselves apart from competitors who rely primarily on conventional bogies.  .“',NULL,NULL,1),(1263,'Alstom','Alstom attains score of “A-” in CDP 2019 climate change ranking','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/alstom-attains-score-cdp-2019-climate-change-ranking','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/01/21/5e26f443818d4.png?itok=URSmGdFq','21 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:33:35','Our commitments\n  \n  \n    Read more',NULL,NULL,1),(1264,'Alstom','Alstom’s orders and sales for the first nine months of 2019/2020','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/alstoms-orders-and-sales-first-nine-months-20192020','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/01/15/20200116_Thumbnail_PR_Q3_2019_20_EN.png?itok=mF4uC_0e','16 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:33:40','',NULL,NULL,1),(1265,'Alstom','Alstom’s 3000th P80 point machine rolled off the production line in Almaty, Kazakhstan','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2020/1/alstoms-3000th-p80-point-machine-rolled-production-line-almaty','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2020/01/15/Alstom_KEP%20%287%29.jpg?itok=FLQaEV5C','16 Jan 2020','2023-09-20 17:33:47','Press contact - Western and Central Asia\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Zaure Shubayeva\n      \n              Send an email,16 January 2020 – Alstom’s JV KEP[1] manufactured its 3000th P80 point machine for Kazakhstan Railways.

It is the first line in Denmark equipped with both ERTMS trackside, on-board signalling solutions and fully integrated with the Traffic Management System from Alstom. The line is a little over 20 km long and the fleet running on the line consists of 12 trains, owned by DSB. \nDenmark is underway to replace their current railway signalling system with ETCS level 2 baseline 3 to further gain passenger capacity and reduce delays. Banedanmark is the first infrastructure owner in Europe to apply this baseline version on a national scale. The opening of the line marks a significant milestone for the Danish signalling program run by Banedanmark, the Danish infrastructure owner. \n\"We are extremely proud to have delivered this milestone for the Danish signalling program roll-out. Alstom has supplied a fully digital system, providing a more efficient rail system, allowing larger capacity while guaranteeing the highest levels of safety” says Emmanuel Henry, Managing Director of Alstom Denmark.\nAlstom is currently replacing the existing signalling system in the Eastern part of Denmark with ERTMS on approximately 800 km of tracks. So far, Alstom has equipped over 100 km with Alstom ERTMS trackside solutions. During the homologation of the Denmark’s first high speed line from Copenhagen to Ringsted in November last year, Alstom set a new railway speed record for Denmark at 255 kph. \nAlstom also holds the contract to equip the entire Danish fleet of approximately 350 trains with Atlas On-board equipment. Already, 20 percent of the fleet is successfully installed and several main operators including DSB, Arriva, Nordjyske Jernbaner, are running commercial operations with the ERTMS system installed on-board the trains. On lines where there is no Trackside ERTMS yet installed, the fitted trains run with a Legacy Systems deployed by Alstom.\nAlstom’s deliveries also include a national Traffic Management System to support the planning of journeys on all lines, both with and without ERTMS, across Zealand, Fyn, and Jutland. The system includes several advanced functions especially developed for mainline railway lines, making it the first of its kind world-wide. \nWith 15 years of experience putting into service ERTMS Level 2 digital signalling solutions, Alstom is a global pioneer in its development and implementation.

Alstom deployed the complete on-board digital solution on all 17 trains delivered by Alstom and on 23 other trains ordered in Switzerland. Full commercial service by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region begins on 15 December. \n \"We are proud to be travelling for the first time on board the Léman Express version of our regional train, Coradia Polyvalent. This event marks the operational launch of our Baseline 3 digital solution ensuring the increase of traffic capacity between the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes French Region and the Geneva Canton in Switzerland.  I am sure that this day is one of many for the future of Europe and a necessary increase of rail connections between countries\" said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\n The Coradia Polyvalent electrical regional trains will run on the four lines of the Léman Express, providing a comprehensive service from Bellegarde to Saint-Gervais (East-West), Annecy to Evian (North-South) and of course the connection with Switzerland (Cantons of Geneva and Vaud).\nThe Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains (Régiolis contract) belong to Alstom\'s Coradia range, of which 326 trains have been already ordered in the world by 9 French regions and 61 Coradia Liner by the French state, the authority responsible for France’s TET (intercity) trains. Nearly 95 million kilometres have already been covered by Régiolis in commercial service.\nThe trains have been adapted to the specific characteristics of the Franco-Swiss cross-border CEVA line: configured in their suburban version, each 72-metre-long train can carry up to 204 seated passengers at a maximum authorised speed of 140 km/h in Switzerland. Designed to ensure cross-border connections with ERTMS technology, the Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains can run on 3 types of network voltages. \nAlstom\'s Atlas ETCS Baseline 3 on-board signalling solution complies with the latest European standards for rail interoperability. It enables trains to travel from one country to another in completely fluid, safe and reliable fashion. Alstom already commissioned it last summer for the cross-border link between France and Luxemburg using Alstom\'s regional trains. This was a first for Baseline 3 in cross-border mode in the signalling market. Implementing this solution on Léman Express takes into account this first successful return on experience. \nTo optimise the fluidity of exchanges and reduce stopping time in stations, the Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains are equipped with a full low-floor, seven doors on each side to facilitate passenger flows, all with bridge plates, and a large reception area on the platforms. Coradia Polyvalent complies with the PRM TSI[2] standard. The interior offers increased comfort thanks to seats equipped with individual reading lights and electrical sockets, as well as spaces dedicated to bicycles and luggage. Large windows and reduced noise levels also improve the quality of the journey. \nManufacturing Coradia Polyvalent involves more than 4,000 jobs in France at Alstom and its suppliers.

Our metro experts are already at work on several of our French sites to get started quickly with developments,\" says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice-President France at Alstom.\n The new trains, based on Alstom\'s rubber-tyred metro solutions, will incorporate the latest technological developments to increase comfort, availability, accessibility and passenger information, as well as facilitate maintenance.\nEach 4-car train, 65 metres long and in \"boa\"[1] configuration, will be able to carry up to 500 passengers[2]. The sleekly designed trains will feature large bay windows, a highly efficient air conditioning system and modern passenger information systems, providing a pleasant on-board experience. Alstom called on Marseille designers Ora-ïto and Fabien Bourdier for the design and the sound conception of the new trains. \nThree designs were proposed to the Metropole Aix-Marseille-Provence, which chose to set up an Internet consultation to give residents the opportunity to give their opinion on the design they would like to see selected.\nThe new metros for Marseille are environmentally friendly and will be eco-designed, enabling them to be 96% recoverable at the end of their lifespan. They will consume 25% less energy than the metros currently in service, thanks in particular to electric braking (up to 0 km/h), LED lighting and other optimisations.\nFor the automation system, Alstom will provide its Urbalis 400 solution, already deployed on more than 1,500 kilometres of metro lines worldwide. The Marseille metro will benefit from a proven, continuously improved system (on-board computers equipped with the latest technology, vital computers that are over 99% available, beacon tracker, etc.).\nAlstom currently equips 25% of the CBTC[3] metro automations in service (60 lines, including 28 fully automated lines).\nIn total, more than 400 people in France will work on this project, including more than 60 in Métropole Aix-Marseille-Provence. Jobs will also be generated at our suppliers in France, but also in the Métropole for the installation and deployment of the signalling system.\nAlstom will draw on the excellent skills of six of its French sites: Aix-en-Provence for the project management, Valenciennes for the design, interior layout, assembly, tests and validation of the trains, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Villeurbanne for the on-board electronics, passenger information, predictive maintenance and signalling system equipment, and Saint-Ouen for the coordination of the artistic design, development and integration of the signalling system.\n[1] Trains with inter-car circulation \n[2] 4 passengers / m2\n[3] Communication Based Train Control: automatic control system based on continuous radio communication between the train and the control centre',NULL,NULL,1),(1290,'Alstom','Alstom to supply driverless trains and digital signalling system for Sydney Metro extension to City and Southwest','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/11/alstom-supply-driverless-trains-and-digital-signalling-system-sydney','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/11/21/Sydney%20Metro.jpg?itok=hrnxsOIO','22 Nov 2019','2023-09-20 17:35:46','Press contacts - Australia\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Sheldon Young\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email,Australia’s biggest public transport project\n22 November 2019 – The Northwest Rapid Transit Consortium (NRT) has reached contractual close for the extension to the existing NRT Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract on Sydney Metro.\nThe contract, which was awarded in 2014, has been extended to deliver a seamless customer experience on the new metro, with NRT to operate and maintain the full metro line from Rouse Hill to Bankstown - in total 66 kilometres of rail and 31 metro stations by 2024.\nAlstom has signed a contract with NRT to supply the rolling stock and signalling system for the next stage of Sydney Metro, Sydney Metro City and Southwest.

The project has included the complete renovation of the signalling and protection systems (ASFA Digital), the installation of new fixed communications systems, as well as the coordination and synchronization with the other works being carried out in the infrastructure at the same time (roads and catenary).\nThanks to this comprehensive reform, the reliability of the line and its facilities will be improved, which will result in a higher quality of the service, especially in Madrid suburban network. In addition, it will ease and improve the infrastructure maintenance works, while passengers’ comfort will be increased. At the same time, security measures of the tunnel will be reinforced, facilitating evacuation, if necessary.\n“The Recoletos Tunnel project has been a real challenge, due to the short deadlines and system complexity. The signalling leadership and experience of Alstom teams in Spain have allow us to successfully achieve our commitment with the client. To reach this goal, a team of more than 140 people from different departments and expertise areas has been coordinated, working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with alternate shifts”, highlights Antonio Moreno, Managing Director of Alstom Spain.\nOver seven kilometres in length, the Recoletos Tunnel is a key infrastructure for the Spanish railway network. This is the tunnel that supports more traffic in the entire network, with about 3,290 weekly circulations (98% are suburban trains). Last June, Adif, Spanish Railway Infrastructure Administrator, started the works for its comprehensive remodeling, including the signalling renewal, track replacement and new catenaries installation.\nAlstom was awarded with the part of the project in charge of the signalling renewal between the Atocha Cercanías and Chamartín stations, including new interlocks for Nuevos Ministerios and Chamartín train stations, the installation of digital ASFA balises and other infrastructure equipment that will allow to increase the security and the number of circulations in the network.\nIn addition to the signalling, Alstom teams have renewed and relocated the telecommunications wiring, replaced the cabin equipment of the contiguous stations with new electronic interlocks (Nuevos Ministerios) and made the necessary blockages with the collateral stations (Atocha and Chamartín), to adapt the signalling of these stations to the new one installed in the tunnel.\nRecoletos tunnel, with more than 7 kilometres length, links the Atocha and Chamartin main stations through the intermediate stations of Recoletos and Nuevos Ministerios. This infrastructure, which serves the C1, C2, C7, C8 and C10 suburban lines, as well as medium and long-distance trains, supports the largest number of circulations of the entire Spanish railway network, with 470 trains and 200,000 daily passengers This strategic tunnel,  that vertebrates the north and south of Madrid, was put into service in 1967.',NULL,NULL,1),(1298,'Alstom','Alstom in partnership with HEC Paris kicks off the Alstom Mid-Management Program for Africa and Middle East employees','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/11/alstom-partnership-hec-paris-kicks-alstom-mid-management-program-africa','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/11/07/Alstom-HEC%20Paris_1.jpg?itok=Tt3i0wxl','07 Nov 2019','2023-09-20 17:36:21','Press contact: Middle East and Turkey\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Bahaa Omran \n      \n              Send an email,7 November 2019 – Alstom, in partnership with HEC Paris, has launched the fourth edition of the Mid-Management Program (M3) for Alstom employees in the Middle East and Africa region (MEA).

The signature took place as part of the “Klimaattop”, or Climate Summit Northern Netherlands, taking place this week in Groningen.\nThe tests will be carried out on the track between Groningen and Leeuwarden at up to 140 km/h and will last about two weeks. The ambition is to organise the test during the first quarter of 2020. The objective is to demonstrate that hydrogen fuel cell technology is an appropriate way to achieve zero-emission rail traffic on non-electrified lines in the Netherlands where there are currently diesel trains running.\n“Alstom is committed to developing and implementing mobility solutions that permit not only the emergence of fully sustainable transport systems but also help drive the broader energy transition. We look forward to demonstrating what has already been proven in Germany – that hydrogen represents a highly suitable way forward in both cases,” said Bernard Belvaux, Managing Director of Alstom Benelux.\nThe Coradia iLint is the world’s first passenger train powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which produces electrical power for traction. The train is quiet and emission-free, emitting only water and steam during operation. It represents a clean alternative for railway operators and regional authorities wishing to replace diesel fleets for operation on non-electrified lines and meet ambitious zero-emission objectives. \nThe world’s first two hydrogen trains have already been in regular passenger service in Lower Saxony in Germany since September 2018. The local transport authority LNVG will operate 14 Coradia iLint trains on that line from 2021. Also in Germany, RMV this ordered 27 Coradia iLint – the largest fleet of hydrogen trains in the world – for operation from 2022. \nThe Dutch railway network has approximatively 1,000 kilometres of non-electrified line.',NULL,NULL,1),(1304,'Alstom','Alstom and CTAZ will develop an innovation project for improving Zaragoza’s metropolitan bus network management','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstom-and-ctaz-will-develop-innovation-project-improving-zaragozas','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/29/CarlosV-2.jpg?itok=LAoW_sXY','29 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:36:49','Press contact - Spain and Portugal\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Irma Aguado \n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email,Pioneer test with Mastria, Alstom’s multimodal solution \nThe objective is to resolve incidents in a real time basis and help to improve route planning and services for passengers.\nThe innovation project will be based on a fleet of buses that includes 6 different operators and covers 30 municipalities, with a total of 25 lines.\n29 October 2019 – CTAZ (Transport Consortium of Zaragoza Area) and Alstom in  Spain are developing a pilot innovation project, based on Alstom’s multimodal solution Mastria, to improve metropolitan bus network management. The ultimate objective is to resolve incidents more quickly in a real time basis and help to improve route planning.  The results of the project will be presented at the Smart City Expo World Congress, held in Barcelona from November 19 to 21.\nBased on the innovative Mastria technology for urban mobility smart management, the objective of this project undertaken by Alstom and CTAZ is to improve bus service efficiency using Big Data and machine learning tools. \nAlstom and CTAZ teams will analyse the bus network schedule and GPS data, including delays, positions, incidents, etc. Thanks to the use of algorithms and smart data analysis (historical and real-time), the analysis will establish a model of automatic incident detection in the bus network of the Zaragoza metropolitan area. \nThe fleet of buses coordinated by CTAZ on which the innovation project will be based includes 6 different operators and covers 30 municipalities, with a total of 25 lines. The organization of this complex network, which annually transports over 5 million passengers, represents a real challenge, as the different operators have diverse internal management mechanisms. The prototype resulting from this joint research aims to coordinate in real time all the network information and improve incident resolution efficiency thereby, offering an improved service for passengers. \n“Thanks to data analytics and collaborative smart tools, the Consortium, will be able to immediately react to any incident in a coordinated way. In addition, we will provide better service to passengers, who will be informed in real time about incidents, disturbances and alternative solutions thanks to Mastria\'s prediction capabilities”, highlights Juan Ortiz, Manager of the Zaragoza Area Transportation Consortium.\n“The metropolitan area of Zaragoza is a key reference in smart mobility planning and public passenger transport with a metropolitan, multimodal and integrated scope. The use of new information technologies to improve multi-operator coordination and daily service to passengers in this area, will allow Alstom to improve and develop our innovations related to digital mobility”, explains Jaime Borrell, Alstom Business Development Director in Spain.\nMastria is a pioneering multimodal supervision solution addressed to operators and transport Authorities worldwide. Thanks to Mastria, all the actors of mobility in a given city can be linked: bus, tram and metro networks but also taxi, shared cars, bikes and police, etc. This technology objective is to maximise fluidity between all the means of transportation in a city and to orchestrate passenger routes. Thanks to the application of advance data analytics, it can also predict and anticipate possible incidents, in order to improve mobility management within the city.',NULL,NULL,1),(1305,'Alstom','An important milestone in Alstom’s first system contract in Vietnam','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/important-milestone-alstoms-first-system-contract-vietnam','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/26/M%C3%A9tro%20Hano%C3%AF%20Alstom%20%C2%A9%20Samuel%20Dhote%2008.jpg?itok=mWJ9G8no','26 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:36:54','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact France - North/North-West \n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Marion Verny\n      \n              Send an email,Alstom on track to complete first train for Hanoi Metro Line 3\n26 October 2019 – Alstom, which is manufacturing 10 trains for Hanoi Metro Line 3, today hosted Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Tran Quoc Vuong, and his delegation to a visit of its train assembly plant in Valenciennes (France). The plant is working to complete the first trainset by the end of October, marking an important milestone in Alstom’s first integrated metro system contract in Vietnam, signed with MRB (Hanoi Metropolitan Railway Management Board) in 2017.\nAs part of the visit, Alstom’s Managing Director for China and East Asia, Olivier Loison, and Chairman of the Hanoi People’s Committee and Mayor of Hanoi, Nguyen Duc Chung, signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the existing contract of Alstom in Hanoi. The agreement aims to foster further collaborative opportunities between both parties for new systems within the Vietnamese capital. \n“We are honoured to have Deputy General Secretary Vuong and his team witness the final assembly of our first train for Hanoi Metro Line 3 here in Valenciennes. This will be an important milestone for the bilateral project as we bring this train to fruition. We look forward to remaining a close and long-term partner of Vietnam, addressing its mobility needs and supporting it in its upcoming transport projects,” said Olivier Loison. \nIn 2017, Alstom, as leader of a consortium including Colas Rail and Thales, was awarded a contract to supply an integrated metro system for Hanoi Metro Line 3. Alstom’s share covered the supply and integration of the metro system, including the 10 trains and the Urbalis 400 signalling system[1], as well as the delivery of power supply and depot equipment together with a partner. The new line is 12.5 kilometres long with 12 stations. It is expected to carry over 23,900 passengers per hour and per direction at peak capacity.\nAlstom puts the passenger at the heart of its train design process. The four-car Metropolis trains for Hanoi Metro Line 3 will feature wide doors to facilitate passenger flow, dedicated space for passengers with reduced mobility, as well as ergonomic and easy-to-grab bars. The trains will be fully electric, with lightweight aluminium car bodies. The train’s exterior and interior colour scheme takes local Vietnamese inspiration and includes motifs such as dragon fruit and the rice paddy field – a design that was well-received by the people at a public consultation held in September 2018.\nWhen completed, the first train will undergo a series of static and dynamic tests at the Valenciennes Railway Testing Centre during the month of November.

The region had already ordered 40 Coradia Polyvalent trains, of which 36 have already been delivered. Deliveries of these new trains will be staggered between 2022 and 2024.\nFirstly, this new order covers 30 trains intended for cross-border circulation in Germany. These 4-car trains, which are dual mode - dual voltage 25 kV / 15 kV and comply with German safety requirements, will run at 160 km/h, serving the German states of Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg. The 30 Coradia Polyvalent cross-border trains will offer a first-class zone and an area for bicycles, and will incorporate the new TSI PRM[2] 2014 standard, notably offering more spacious toilets to facilitate movement for passengers with reduced mobility. The first cross-border trains will be delivered at the end of 2023.\nSecondly, nine additional Coradia Polyvalent trains, consisting of five 4-car and four 6-car trains, have been added to the existing fleet for domestic connections. These new trains will benefit from the same special features as those already in operation in the Grand Est region. \n\"Alstom is proud of this new sign of trust from the Grand Est region. The expertise and innovation capacities of our French teams are mobilised to support the region in developing cross-border mobility. This order also contributes to the activity of Alstom\'s Reichshoffen site,\" says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\nCoradia Polyvalent belongs to Alstom\'s Coradia range of trains. With its modular architecture, it can be adapted to the requirements of each public transport authority as well as to different types of use: suburban, regional and intercity. It comes in three lengths (56, 72 or 110 metres) and offers optimal comfort to passengers, whatever the length of the journey. The train is both ecological and economical due to its low energy consumption, its compliance with the latest emissions standards in thermal mode and its reduced maintenance costs. Coradia Polyvalent is the first French regional train to comply with all European standards, in particular with regard to access for people with reduced mobility.\nTo date, 387 Coradia Polyvalent trains have been ordered as part of the contract awarded to Alstom by SNCF in October 2009, including 320 Coradia Polyvalent for Régiolis by 9 French regions and 67 Coradia Liner by the French state, the authority responsible for the country’s TET (intercity) trains. Régiolis has already covered nearly 85 million kilometres in commercial service.\nThe Coradia Polyvalent train also meets the needs of the export market: 17 trains have been ordered by SNTF (Algeria) and 15 trains by APIX (Senegal). \nThis is Coradia Polyvalent\'s second cross-border application as the region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes has ordered 17 Léman Express Coradia Polyvalent trains, to be commissioned on the CEVA cross-border line between France and Switzerland in mid-December 2019.\nThe manufacturing of Coradia Polyvalent secures more than 4,000 jobs in France for Alstom and its suppliers. Six of Alstom\'s 12 sites in France are involved in the project: Reichshoffen for the design and assembly, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction chains, Villeurbanne for the on-board electronics and signalling products, and Saint-Ouen for the design.\n[1] Booked in the second quarter of the current fiscal year \n[2] Technical Specifications for Interoperability relating to Persons with Reduced Mobility',NULL,NULL,1),(1308,'Alstom','Alstom Egypt and National Authority for tunnels celebrate the entry into commercial service of the  “Heliopolis” metro station','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstom-egypt-and-national-authority-tunnels-celebrate-entry-commercial','','20 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:08','',NULL,NULL,1),(1309,'Alstom','Alstom’s tram enters service in Avignon','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstoms-tram-enters-service-avignon','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/19/RID-ALST-14024%20%281%29.jpg?itok=6TmvAf1n','19 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:14','Press contacts - Southeast France (Fabienne Broccard)\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Fabienne Broccard\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,19 October 2019 – Alstom has commissioned its first new-generation Citadis X05 tram in its short version, on the first tramway line of Grand Avignon. \n\"Alstom and its teams are proud to be present at the commissioning of this first tramway line in Avignon. Thanks to their reliability, availability and easier maintenance, we are fully confident in the ability of the 14 Citadis trams to address the major travel challenges of the Agglomeration Community of Grand Avignon. I would also like to thank the members of Grand Avignon for having entrusted us with part of the infrastructural work. This new line will become a showcase for the expertise of the French rail sector,\" said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\n24 metres long, equipped with 4 double doors on each side, the Citadis X05 tram for Grand Avignon will be able to carry more than 140 passengers. The full low floor and double doors facilitate accessibility and passenger exchange in stations. Everything has been designed for a pleasant travel experience: large bay windows covering 40% of the tram, LEDs with diffusers for soft, homogenous lighting, a state-of-the-art information system, large seats, air conditioning, and a video protection system.\nCitadis X05 has standardised, proven, more accessible components, providing residents of the Avignon area with reliable, readily available material. Citadis X05 is particularly energy efficient and up to 99% recyclable.\nAlstom offers a wide range of products and services and has also provided the tracks (studies, supply and assembly), the 750 V electrical substation and 6 km of overhead contact lines (studies, supply, installation and testing) in partnership with TSO.\nSeven of Alstom’s thirteen sites in France are involved in the design and manufacture of the tram for Grand Avignon: La Rochelle (for the design and assembly of the trams), Ornans (for the engines), Le Creusot (for the bogies), Tarbes (for the traction drive equipment), Valenciennes (for the control system and interior layout), Saint-Ouen (for the design and infrastructure activities) and Villeurbanne (for the on-board electronic systems).',NULL,NULL,1),(1310,'Alstom','Alstom’s joint-venture Ubunye inaugurates its world class rail factory in South Africa','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstoms-joint-venture-ubunye-inaugurates-its-world-class-rail-factory','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/17/IMG-20191017-WA0010.jpg?itok=AwE9T7Lp','17 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:18','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,17 October 2019 – Alstom Ubunye rail factory, one of Alstom’s joint-ventures in South Africa, was officially inaugurated on 17 October 2019, in Ekurhuleni, in the presence of the Premier of Gauteng, Mr David Makhura, Dr. Nkosindiphile Xhakaza, MMC (Member of the Mayoral Committee) for Finance and Economic Development in Ekurhuleni, the French Ambassador in South Africa, Mr Aurélien Lechevallier, and Alstom Chairman & CEO, Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge, together with 100 guests and 565 employees.\nAlstom, through its two South African joint-venture companies, Alstom Ubunye and the Gibela Rail Transportation Consortium, is proud to be part of the development of rail transportation in South Africa.  Through the two factories situated in Ekurhuleni, near Johannesburg, Alstom is committed to creating a sustainable future for the more than 1500 local employees. Both JV’s are well established South African companies, with local partners, more than 95% local employees, with unique skills and technology transfer programmes. Besides its long-term ambitions for the country, Alstom is also making an impact on local communities through several social investment programmes. \n“Since 2016 we embarked on a huge programme and investment to modernize the Alstom Ubunye factory in order to supply components for 150 trains to Gibela Rail, where the new PRASA trains are being built. The unique transfer of technology from our  sites across the world has created a rail factory hub with world-class competencies. We are confident in the future of South Africa and have established this industrial footprint with a long-term vision to be an African Rail Hub of excellence.” said Henri Poupart-Lafarge.\nOver the past 3 years, the factory has been transformed in its entirety to ensure Alstom Ubunye can meet the demands of its customers. A significant investment has been undertaken in upskilling employees and installing state of the art equipment such as advanced robot technology. The factory has recently been certified to EN 15085 CL1 and ISO 3834-2, the highest welding certification level in the industry, globally. This CL1 certification applies to safety critical components such as bogie frames, End Under Frames (EUF) and anti-intrusion boxes.\nIn Full Nominal Mode Ubunye will deliver 62 bogies, 62 end under frames, 20 traction cases and 10 Static Inverters per month. It will also manufacture looming, cubicles and PACIS (Passenger Public Address, Closed Circuit Television and Information Systems), and prepare to serve the expected increasing demand for rail innovation in Sub-Saharan countries.\nThrough the modernisation of Alstom Ubunye, Alstom has established an African rail company with local partners (IDC and CTE), creating a stronger industrial and commercial base with the purpose to offer a complete transport portfolio to address Southern Africa’s railway transport needs.',NULL,NULL,1),(1311,'Alstom','Railway Children and Social Mobility Foundation set to benefit in UK','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/railway-children-and-social-mobility-foundation-set-benefit-uk','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/22/SMF%20Students%20Photos%20Girls.jpg?itok=DlhyttN7','17 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:22','Press contact United Kingdom & Ireland\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Kathryn Lancaster\n      \n              Send an email,17 October 2019 - The Alstom Corporate Foundation has announced its final selection of projects for the 2019 cycle. With a total of 158 projects having been submitted, Alstom employees have once again demonstrated their enthusiasm for philanthropy and for supporting local communities. \nAmong the projects, the Foundation has selected a Social Mobility Foundation project in Liverpool and the Railway Children project in the North West of England.\nRailway Children is an international charity which provides a national safety network for children who runaway to railway stations and on to trains, leaving them vulnerable to violence, abuse and exploitation. The Railway Children Safeguarding on Transport project, supported by Alstom, will help children and young people across the North West of England, home to several of Alstom’s sites including their train modernisation centre in Widnes. Making children on the street visible to society is vital and this funding will directly employ two full-time project workers and a project coordinator to identify and support children in crisis. Further, it will fund the development of multi-agency quick response groups across the transport system to directly help children and young people at risk and safeguard them from danger.  \n“Thanks to the Alstom Foundation, we will be able to support more vulnerable children in the North West found in and around the rail network. We are really looking forward to working together to transform lives.” Commented Joe Clay, Railway Children Group Project Co-Ordinator.\nSecondly, Alstom are set to continue their support for the Social Mobility Foundation in Liverpool that was also supported in 2017 and 2018 with Alstom Foundation funding. The project contributes to the Aspiring Professionals Programme (APP), which supports talented A level students from disadvantaged backgrounds in and around Liverpool. New for 2020, there will be an inspiring residential programme in London for Liverpool students, with an additional focus on providing a support network for low performing groups under-represented in higher education. \n“We are delighted to be chosen as one of the charities the Alstom Foundation would like to support this year. This is the third year that we will be supported by the Alstom Foundation and their continued support shows their commitment to improving social mobility for young people in Liverpool. This funding will allow young people from low-income backgrounds to benefit from a whole range of activity to help them reach their aspirations.” Said Sally Weatherall, Head of Regional Development at the Social Mobility Foundation.\n“The Railway Children and Social Mobility Foundation are two fantastic causes making every effort to broaden social mobility and protection for those most in need in society. We are always keen to support the communities from across the regions Alstom operate, and through these amazing projects we will continue to ensure our contributions to our local communities are both sustainable and make a lasting improvement to people’s lives” said Nick Crossfield, Alstom UK & Ireland Managing Director\n“I am delighted to see my Alstom colleagues demonstrating such a strong citizenship commitment! In response to such a determination to support local communities the Group has decided to increase the Foundation’s annual budget for project funding. Starting this year, the Foundation will have a budget of 1.5 million euros, an increase of 50% over that of previous years. This will allow it to support a greater number of projects and/or those of a higher value,” said Barry Howe, Secretary General of the Alstom Foundation.\nThis year, the Foundation’s Board has selected 25 projects for funding from its 2019/20 budget – a significant increase on the 16 projects funded last year.\nEstablished in 2007, the Alstom Foundation supports and funds projects proposed by Alstom employees who team up with local NGO partners and not-for-profit organizations to carry out initiatives aimed at improving living conditions in communities located near the Groups facilities and project sites around the world.

After the four prototypes that have been on the roads of many French and European cities for the past two years, this new design incorporates feedback from passengers and transport operators.\nThis first serial vehicle is based on an optimised global architecture requiring fewer spare parts references and considerably facilitating maintenance operations. Thanks to a wheel steering angle of more than 40°, its ease of insertion increases significantly. The 15% reduction in the total weight of the vehicle, combined with the use of new, more efficient and state of the art batteries, substantially increases range. Aptis now accommodates more passengers while still offering them more fluidity thanks to large sliding doors. \nIn addition to the technical improvements, Aptis can also boast significant improvements to passenger comfort. A new air-conditioning system that (fully electrical heat-pump) maximises thermal comfort and the panoramic rear lounge has been enhanced to give a feeling of increased space. The new hydraulic suspension allows superior comfort and sound insulation, making Aptis one of the quietest and most innovative buses on the market. \n“Alstom and its teams are very proud to be presenting the first series version of Aptis. This concentration of innovations perfectly represents what we always envisaged the production version of the 100% electric mobility solution would be. This clean, green bus, with its elegant design and optimised technical performance, will offer a new experience to passengers and drivers while meeting the new mobility challenges of urban areas,\" underlines Benjamin Bailly, head of Alstom’s electric bus platform.\nAptis has already been chosen by Paris in the context of Europe’s largest call for tender for electric buses, as well as by the cities of Strasbourg, Grenoble, La Rochelle and Toulon. Upcoming milestones include ongoing tests in Spain with the ground-based recharge solution SRS and the training of hundreds of drivers in a new driving experience ahead of the first traffic releases, scheduled for the end of the year in Strasbourg. \nManufacturing and testing of Aptis will be carried out at Alstom\'s two sites in Alsace. The Hangenbieten site oversees manufacturing of the end modules (driver\'s cab and rear lounge). Manufacturing of the central passenger module, final assembly and tests will be carried out at the Reichshoffen site. This scheme will allow serial production from the end of 2019 onwards. Five other Alstom sites in France contribute to the design and manufacture of Aptis: Saint-Ouen for system integration, Tarbes for traction, Ornans for engines, Villeurbanne for electronic components of the traction chain. \nIn order to complete Alstom’s vision of road electromobility, exhibited alongside Aptis at Busworld will also be SRS, a completely safe, ground-level, conductive, static recharge system allowing the charging of buses along their route or within depots. As a ground-based solution, it eliminates the need for overhead infrastructure in cities, preserving the aesthetics of the urban landscape. In depots, SRS avoids the infrastructure costs associated with overhead charging systems. SRS for e-buses is based on Alstom’s SRS static recharge technology for trams, a proven solution already in operation in Nice, France. It is developed at Alstom’s Vitrolles site.\nCome and see us at Busworld from 18 – 23 OctoberAlstom booth: Hall 2, Booth 202B',NULL,NULL,1),(1313,'Alstom','Alstom will implement spaces for people with reduced mobility in 117 trains of Metro de Santiago','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstom-will-implement-spaces-people-reduced-mobility-117-trains-metro','','14 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:35','',NULL,NULL,1),(1314,'Alstom','Alstom will provide automatic piloting and  interlocking system for Santiago Metro Line 2 extension','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstom-will-provide-automatic-piloting-and-interlocking-system-santiago','','14 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:40','',NULL,NULL,1),(1315,'Alstom','Alstom Foundation to support 25 new projects around the world','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/10/alstom-foundation-support-25-new-projects-around-world','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/09/_m7a5906.jpg?itok=pcPp53Gm','09 Oct 2019','2023-09-20 17:37:45','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email,9 October 2019 - The Alstom Corporate Foundation has announced its final selection of projects for the 2019 cycle.

The premiere, as part of the PALOMA pilot project currently underway in the southern Spanish city, sees a prototype of SRS for e-buses operating at a bus stop in front of the University of Malaga’s School of Industrial Engineering. It is equipped with a 200kW charger and is associated with a twelve-metre Linkker e-bus which is running on Bus Line 1, operated by EMT, the local transport operator. \nPALOMA (Prototype for Alternative Operation of Mobility Assets) is a pilot project co–financed by the EU through the European Regional Development Found and CDTI funding tool. Alstom is leading a consortium with partners Endesa, a Spanish utilities provider, and Mansel, electrification contractor, and working with the support of the City of Malaga, transport operator EMT Malaga and the University of Malaga. The objective: to create the world’s first operating prototype of an automatic, ground-level rapid charging system for a 100% electric bus. \n“This installation of SRS for e-buses in an important step for both Alstom and the city of Malaga, taking us a step further in the move towards fully sustainable urban mobility. We are proud of what has been achieved in collaboration with our consortium partners Endesa and Mansel, and of course the support of the City of Malaga and EMT Malaga, both of which are now pioneers. The project in Spain shows a way forward for the smooth operation of the enormous electric bus fleets we will see in coming years across Europe,” said Eric Marie, Vice President of Systems & Infrastructure at Alstom. \nCities are increasingly committing to ambitious decarbonisation targets, with some, including Paris, Brussels and Madrid, aiming to eradicate internal combustion engines by 2030. Electric buses feature prominently in these roadmaps, driving demand for recharging systems that are efficient, unobtrusive and compatible with varied and growing electric bus fleets. \nAlstom’s SRS for e-buses offers numerous advantages to cities and bus operators. SRS is a completely safe, ground-level, conductive, static recharge system allowing the charging of on-board equipment automatically, in “top-up” mode in a few minutes on a bus line, or within the depots, when off duty. As a ground-based solution, it eliminates the need for overhead infrastructure in cities, preserving the aesthetics of the urban landscape. In depots, SRS avoids the infrastructure costs associated with overhead charging systems and maximises ease of maintenance, with onboard access compatible with existing pits within workshops. SRS is scalable, interoperable and non-proprietary, meaning it can be used for fleets of various bus types, regardless of manufacturer or changes in battery technology. \nSRS for e-buses is based on Alstom’s SRS static recharge technology for trams, a proven solution already in operation in Nice, France. For more than 15 years, Alstom has been developing and deploying catenary-free recharge solutions that enable the complete technical and aesthetic integration of trams into historic city centres. These APS and SRS solutions have been sold to 12 cities around the globe and have seen more than 40 million kilometres of tram operation.',NULL,NULL,1),(1319,'Alstom','A new step forward for the Paris-Lyon high speed line: Alstom’s digital signalling technology chosen  by SNCF Réseau','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/9/new-step-forward-paris-lyon-high-speed-line-alstoms-digital-signalling-technology-chosen-sncf-reseau','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/09/25/Euroduplex_LD_Alstom%20%20A.%20F%C3%A9vrier.jpg?itok=6NZij-g_','25 Sep 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:02','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,25 September 2019 – Alstom, in a consortium with Setec Ferroviaire, has been awarded a contract worth approximately 50 million euros by SNCF Réseau to supply its Atlas ERTMS[1] Level 2 system, configurable to the hybrid Level 3, on over 500 kilometres of the Paris-Lyon high speed line. The project, called “LGV+ Paris-Lyon”, is one of the first major realisations of the high-performance rail network. Alstom will carry out the design, equipment supply, installation work, tests and maintenance of its Atlas solution. Setec Ferroviaire will be in charge of verifying the design, integrated project management and testing.\nThe Paris-Lyon line, pilot project of the high-performance rail network\nThe Paris-Lyon high speed line is the busiest route in Europe with 240 trains per day on the main section. It is likely to become even busier in the years to come, particularly in the context of the opening up of the rail passenger transport market. In its current configuration, it is at maximum capacity. Modernising the line is a priority project for SNCF Réseau as well as for Europe, which is devoting 125 million euros to the project.\nTechnological innovation will be used to optimise the existing infrastructure. From 2025, 14 trains will be able to operate in each direction during peak hours, then, following additional infrastructure work, 16 trains by 2030 compared with 13 at present. In parallel, the project will improve the regularity of traffic and adapt the line to European interoperability standards between countries.\nTo increase the line\'s performance, SNCF Réseau plans to carry out a technological breakthrough by regenerating the interlocking centres using computer-based interlocking, as well as by reinforcing the train power supply system and finally by equipping its infrastructure with several technological innovations: ERTMS 2 (signalling system), Centralised Network Control (railway “control tower”) and Operational Traffic Management 2.0.\n“The LGV+ Paris-Lyon project is one of the cornerstones of the high-performance rail network. We’re going to switch to high throughput on this key European transport link. Increasing the capacity of the existing network and the quality of service of traffic is a priority for SNCF Réseau to promote rail use. This collaboration with Alstom is a major step forward for the project,” says Patrick Jeantet, Chairman and CEO of SNCF Réseau.\nThe ERTMS 2 system, using digital to serve railway signalling\nERTMS makes it possible to manage the distance between two trains in real time, thus improving the line\'s capacity and regularity while meeting the objective of interoperability between the various European networks. ERTMS Level 2 is the most advanced, reliable and robust signalling system in existence. It is intended to replace, in the coming years, the 27 systems currently in service in Europe. Alstom\'s Atlas ERTMS Level 2 system is a digital signalling solution that allows trains to run without lineside signalling.\nIn France, following the deployment of the ERTMS Level 1 Atlas solution on Rail Freight Corridor 2 (Rotterdam/Antwerp - Luxembourg - Basel/Lyon), ERTMS Level 2 Atlas will, for the first time, be implemented on a high speed line without interrupting traffic.\n“We are very proud to win this contract and to support SNCF Réseau in its ambitions. This project is a key step in the development of the future high-performance rail network in France. After the commissioning of Atlas ERTMS Level 2 technology in Spain on the Valladolid-Léon very high speed line, this contract is further proof of Alstom\'s expertise and its status as a leader in this field,” says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President France at Alstom.\nOn a global level, and with 15 years of experience in the implementation of ERTMS digital signalling solutions, Alstom is a pioneer in the development and implementation of these solutions and a leader in the domain of on-board equipment. With projects in 30 countries, Alstom has installed nearly 40% of the ERTMS Level 2 trackside equipment in service in Europe, and equipped more than 8,000 trains of 200 different types with its Atlas ERTMS solution. Atlas is a scalable solution that can be adapted to all types of traffic and operational needs: passenger and freight, high speed or suburban.\nThe Atlas ERTMS Level 2 system for the Paris-Lyon line will be developed at Alstom\'s centre of excellence for rail signalling systems in Charleroi, Belgium. The project management will be carried out by a dedicated team at Alstom\'s headquarters in Saint-Ouen in France which, with over 2,800 employees, is the largest railway engineering centre in Europe. In the long term, about 60 people at Alstom and Setec Ferroviaire will work on this project. At SNCF Réseau, more than 50 people will work on monitoring the development of ERTMS.\nMore information about the LGV+ project\n\n[1] ERTMS: European Railways Traffic Management System',NULL,NULL,1),(1320,'Alstom','Alstom to equip 17 ICE3 high speed trains with ETCS','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/9/alstom-equip-17-ice3-high-speed-trains-etcs','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/02/5d94bc9cca262.png?itok=A7hn_jyC','23 Sep 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:06','',NULL,NULL,1),(1321,'Alstom','Alstom participates in an innovation project of rapid recharging systems in stops dedicated to electric buses','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/9/alstom-participates-innovation-project-rapid-recharging-systems-stops','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/10/02/ALSTOM%20-%20Bus%20SRS%20Malaga.00_00_56_17.Still006.png?itok=XBDDDn9e','20 Sep 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:12','Press contact - Spain and Portugal\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Irma Aguado \n      \n              Send an email,PALOMA project, developed in consortium with Endesa and Mansel, has the goal of integrating an opportunist recharging solution for 100% electric buses.\nMadrid, September 2019 - Urban and interurban mobility are part of a global change that do not only affects private vehicles. In that process, companies must provide an innovative vision that shows how the future will be like by looking for prototypes for alternative operations of mobility assets.\nThis is the meaning of PALOMA (Prototype for ALternative Operation of Mobility Assets), the first global prototype for rapid charging for electric buses.\nA project to double buses autonomy\nThis static charging technology, developed by Alstom, is integrated in the pavement in line terminals, to allow a rapid charging and effectiveness through direct contact. This kind of systems facilitate the integration of chargers in the urban landscape, do not add obstacles to the traffic flow, and improve the autonomy of the bus, which will only need to stop for full recharging at the end of the day.\nDue to the characteristics of the project, an advanced monitoring system for the medium and low voltage distribution network has also been implemented, through an automatic transformation center.\nThe goal of this initiative is to guaranty buses autonomy without affecting passengers’ timeouts, with the consequent advance in technological innovation that surrounds electric mobility.\nMálaga, testing laboratory for future mobility\nAlstom’s static recharge technology for trams has served as a base to develop the system employed in PALOMA’s project.

Today, the transport sector alone represents 25% of worldwide emissions. Reinforced concerns on air quality have also led authorities to take concrete steps to trigger energy transition in transport.\nThere are encouraging signs. More than 50% of cars sold in Norway today are electric. Soft and alternative transport modes are developing in cities. Citizens feel more and more concerned about their own impact when travelling and opt for low carbon options or limit air travel when possible. However, a lot still remains to be done.\nAt Alstom, we have recognized some time ago the crucial role we can play in this transition by providing efficient, shared and electrical transport systems.\nOver the years, we have raised the focus on eco-design in railway systems. We were first in the industry to announce a global target and systematically track the energy consumption in our solutions (17% reduction in average between 2014 and 2019). And we have put some unique solutions on the market such as our hydrogen regional train or SRS, our inovative static ground-based charging system in order to develop our low emissions portfolio.\nIn a few years’ time, the Company has positioned itself as a key player in the sustainable mobility arena.\nToday we respond to the urgency of the situation, as well as to the growing expectations of our customers with a renewed commitment to innovation in greener mobility solutions. Our newly launched strategic plan Alstom in Motion sets the path for our continued leadership in this area.\nThe teams will continue to innovate for a full portfolio of green traction solutions as an alternative to diesel and accelerate the development of complete systems for electrical road mobility.

Following a contract signed with WSW mobil GmbH, Alstom equipped the entire suspended route, including 31 new vehicles and the century-old imperial wagon (Kaiserwagen), with ETCS, the European standard for train control systems. \nThe entry into service marks the completion of Alstom’s first full train control and signalling contract in Germany. It comprises line-side equipment, such as interlocking, radio block centre (RBC) and necessary line elements via train control systems, as well as an interface to the computer-aided operation control system. \nThe Wuppertal project represents the very first application of ERTMS Level 3 in which track occupancy is solely realised using train localisation performed by the ETCS equipment onboard the train. Alstom replaced the traditional trackside train detection systems such as axle counters with a digital signalling system whereby the ETCS-equipped vehicles communicate their positions directly to the central computer (or RBC) via radio. \n“With the successful implementation of this project, Wuppertal is the first city in Germany to use the European train control system in urban transport. ETCS does not only provide for safer and more efficient train operation, but also serves as a basis for many future technologies,” says Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director of Alstom in Germany and Austria. \nAlstom’s ETCS system Atlas was developed in Charleroi (Belgium), while the system components were produced at Alstom’s sites in Villeurbanne (France) and Bologna (Italy). The systems are installed and commissioned in Wuppertal by Alstom staff from Charleroi, Salzgitter and Berlin.\nAlstom is market leader for ETCS on-board equipment. Since 2006, Alstom has equipped 8,200 vehicles (3,200 of which are already in operation) and for 18,000 kilometres of line (7,000 in operation) with ETCS equipment. A large part of DB’s ICE fleet has also been running with Alstom’s ETCS technologies on the high-speed line between Berlin and Munich since 2017.',NULL,NULL,1),(1327,'Alstom','Alstom to showcase its innovative and sustainable solutions at Expo Ferroviaria 2019','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/8/alstom-showcase-its-innovative-and-sustainable-solutions-expo','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/08/29/Foto%20Aptis.jpg?itok=tf3gL3Dd','28 Aug 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:44','Press contacts - Italy\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Gaia Mazzon\n      \n              Send an email,28 August 2019 - Alstom will introduce its new brand identity \"mobility by nature\" at Expo Ferroviaria 2019 (1-3 October / Rho Fiera-MI) presenting its innovative and sustainable solutions for mobility. At the Alstom booth (n.108, pavilion 2) visitors will have a global overview of the company\'s latest solutions for transport and take a  journey among the four main activities of Alstom: trains, infrastructure, signalling and services.\nInnovation will be showcased through: Coradia iLint, already in passenger service in Germany, the first train in the world powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which produces electricity for traction; the Coradia Stream \"Pop\" train, considered by Trenitalia the new generation train for regional transport, already operating in Emilia-Romagna and soon in other regions. Not only trains but also Aptis, Alstom\'s 100% electric e-bus, which last spring successfully completed its drive test in five Italian cities: Florence, Genoa, Bologna, Merano and Turin.\nAs far as infrastructure is concerned, Alstom will present its three catenary-free solutions : APS, a ground power system that, with the addition of a third rail between the two tracks, removes overhead lines, preserving thus the urban architectural heritage; SRS, a static ground recharging solution suitable for both trams and buses and Citadis Ecopack, batteries and super energy storage capacitors.\nSignalling will also play an important role at Expo Ferroviaria 2019. Visitors will appreciate the potential of Mastria, the first multimodal supervision solution, connecting all actors of mobility in a given city: bus, tram and underground networks but also taxis, car and bike sharing, police, etc. The objective is to maximize the fluidity of all means of transport in a city and to orchestrate the itineraries of the passengers. The booth will also see the presence of an area dedicated to services with 4.0 maintenance examples and the HealthHub system, a preventive maintenance tool capable of monitoring the health status of trains, infrastructure and signalling resources, analysing advanced data to predict their remaining useful life.\nFor further information, visit: http://www.expoferroviaria.com/',NULL,NULL,1),(1328,'Alstom','Alstom has delivered the first Coradia Polyvalent regional trains for Régiolis Léman Express','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/8/alstom-has-delivered-first-coradia-polyvalent-regional-trains-regiolis','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/08/26/expedition%20LEX%202%20copyright%20Alstom_Jean%20Schweitzerweb_0.jpg?itok=XYafUbRH','27 Aug 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:48','Press contacts - Southeast France (Fabienne Broccard)\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Fabienne Broccard\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,27 August 2019 – Alstom has delivered the first five Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains for the cross-border CEVA[1] line to the SNCF Technicentre in Annemasse. Five trains will now be delivered each month until the end of November, with entry into commercial service scheduled for 15 December 2019. Since mid-August, Alstom\'s teams have been supporting SNCF in training drivers for these new trains.\nA total of 17 trains from Alstom\'s Coradia Polyvalent range have been ordered[2] by SNCF, financed entirely by the region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, to run on the Léman Express, Europe\'s largest cross-border rail network (45 stations, 230 km). The Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains contribute to providing a sustainable alternative to the car for the daily commutes of Greater Geneva’s residents, as well as a better service to the economic and tourist hubs of the entire region. Today, just 16% of the 550,000 daily cross-border trips are made on public transport.\nThe Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains belong to Alstom\'s Coradia range, of which 348 trains have been sold to 9 French regions[3] as part of the contract awarded to Alstom by SNCF in October 2009. The fleet has already covered more than 50 million kilometres in commercial service. \nThe trains have been adapted to the specific characteristics of the Franco-Swiss cross-border CEVA line: configured in their suburban version, each 72-metre train can carry up to 204 seated passengers at speeds of up to 140 km/h, in accordance with Swiss certification. Designed to ensure cross-border connections with ERTMS technology[4], Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains can run on several types of network voltages[5].\nTo optimise the fluidity of passenger exchanges and reduce stopping time in stations, the Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains are equipped with a full low floor, seven doors on each side, all with bridge plates, and a large reception area on the platforms. Coradia Polyvalent is the first train to comply with the PRM-TSI standard[6]. The interior offers increased comfort thanks to the seats equipped with individual reading lights and electrical sockets and the spaces dedicated to bicycles and luggage. Large windows and reduced noise levels also improve the quality of the journey.\nThe manufacturing of Coradia Polyvalent involves more than 4,000 jobs in France at Alstom and its suppliers. Six of Alstom\'s 13 sites in France are involved in the project: Reichshoffen for the design and assembly, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction chains, Villeurbanne for the on-board computerised systems and signalling products, and Saint-Ouen for the design.\n[1] Cornavin – Eaux-Vives – Annemasse line\n[2] Option exercised in July 2015 for the sum of 160 million euros\n[3] Including 10 additional Léman Express trains for the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in July 2019 (approximately 70 million euros)\n[4] European rail interoperability standard\n[5] 25 kV, 1500 V and 15kV for Germany and Switzerland\n[6] Technical specifications for interoperability relating to persons with reduced mobility',NULL,NULL,1),(1329,'Alstom','Alstom hits a century with the 100th ‘Make-in-India’ Metro Trainset rolling out of its Sricity facility','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/8/alstom-hits-century-100th-make-india-metro-trainset-rolling-out-its','','05 Aug 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:52','',NULL,NULL,1),(1330,'Alstom','Alstom selected to provide the trains  of the future CDG Express line','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/8/alstom-selected-provide-trains-future-cdg-express-line','','01 Aug 2019','2023-09-20 17:38:57','',NULL,NULL,1),(1331,'Alstom','Alstom to supply 12 Avelia Euroduplex trains to SNCF for the TGV Atlantique lines','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/7/alstom-supply-12-avelia-euroduplex-trains-sncf-tgv-atlantique-lines','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/07/31/Avelia-euroduplex-2.jpg?itok=Kb4BIk4b','31 Jul 2019','2023-09-20 17:39:03','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor\'s contact\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Julien Minot\n      \n              Send an email,31 July 2019 – Alstom will supply 12 Avelia Euroduplex trains to SNCF Mobilités for the sum of €335 million. This order is in addition to the one for 55 trains currently being delivered. The 12 trains will enter service in 2021 and 2022. They will replace older trains, some of which are over 30 years old.\nA first order for 40 trains had been signed with SNCF in September 2013[1], and 15 additional options were exercised in 2017. To date, 41 trains have been delivered, with the first ones entering commercial service on 11 December 2016 between Paris and Bordeaux.\n“I am very happy that SNCF has renewed its trust in us. The feedback from passengers who travel regularly on these very high speed trains is very positive. This order is excellent news for the sites that produce these trains and will, in particular, ensure the workload of La Rochelle and Belfort in 2020 and 2021, before the delivery of the new generation trains ordered in 2018. The production of these Avelia Euroduplex trains will represent employment for 400 people in La Rochelle and 120 people in Belfort,” said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President France at Alstom.\nThe Avelia Euroduplex trains have higher capacity, with 556 seats compared to 509 for previous generations. Alstom has placed the passenger at the heart of the development of this material by proposing a new concept for more comfortable, more ergonomic seats with a high level of equipment (electrical sockets, USB sockets, reading lamp, etc.). Alstom has also developed an innovative system allowing first-class seats to rotate 180° so that passengers always face the direction of travel. The particularity of the trains for this additional order is that they have been preconfigured to receive a new-generation automatic speed control system meeting the very latest European standards (ERTMS). This train offers greater accessibility for PRM[2] passengers thanks to its increased reception capacity and the incorporation of a door location aid, as well as the evolution of the toilet handles and indicators (tactile). The train has also been preconfigured as necessary to allow operators to offer Wi-Fi on board.\nEuroduplex belongs to Alstom\'s Avelia range of high-speed trains. Eight of Alstom\'s 13 sites in France are involved in its design and manufacture: La Rochelle for the design and assembly, Belfort for the power cars, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction chains, Villeurbanne for the on-board computerised systems, Petit-Quevilly for the traction transformers and Saint-Ouen for the design.\n[1] This was part of a contract concluded between Alstom and SNCF on 27 June 2007\n[2] Passengers with Reduced Mobility',NULL,NULL,1),(1332,'Alstom','Alstom to supply 10 additional Coradia Polyvalent  to the region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/7/alstom-supply-10-additional-coradia-polyvalent-region-auvergne-rhone','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/07/30/Coradia.jpg?itok=Hy8Y6HVf','30 Jul 2019','2023-09-20 17:39:07','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - South-East\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Pauline Odetto \n      \n              Send an email,30 July 2019 – Alstom will supply 10 additional Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains to the French region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes for a sum of approximately 70 million euros. They will operate mainly in the north-east of the region, notably the department of Haute-Savoie, to create a modern, homogeneous fleet in this developing sector. Deliveries will take place from December 2020 to May 2021.\nThe region had already ordered 17 Coradia Polyvalent[1], due to enter service on the Franco-Swiss cross-border Léman Express line in mid-December 2019.\nMade up of four cars, the Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains provide a total capacity of 204 seats with a ‘suburban’-style interior layout and a high level of comfort: seats equipped with individual reading lights and electric sockets, mild air conditioning adjusted to the occupancy rate (CO2 measurement) for better climatic comfort, dedicated bicycle areas, large windows, a full low floor for ease of access, and reduced noise and vibration levels. At the region’s request, the 10 Coradia Polyvalent trains will be equipped with security cameras. The region also asked for their Wi-Fi equipment to be carefully designed to offer a high-quality service, very much in demand among the passengers.\nThese new Coradia Polyvalent trains will benefit from the same characteristics as those due to enter operation on the Léman Express network: seven doors on each side, all equipped with bridge plates, a large reception area on the platforms and a first-class area. Designed to ensure cross-border connections with ERTMS[2] technology, Coradia Polyvalent Léman Express trains can run on several types of network voltages[3].\n\"Alstom is honoured by this renewed sign of confidence from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. The expertise and innovation capacities of our French teams are mobilised to support the region’s modernisation plan for the regional TER rail lines, for the passengers’ benefit. These new trains with high comfort levels, in compliance with the latest standards and accessibility requirements for people with reduced mobility, will incorporate the latest technology in terms of information and connectivity. This order also contributes to the activity of the Alstom site located in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, in Villeurbanne,\" says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\nCoradia Polyvalent for Régiolis belongs to Alstom\'s Coradia range of trains. With its modular architecture, it can be adapted to the requirements of each public transport authority as well as to different types of use: suburban, regional and intercity. It comes in three lengths (56, 72 or 110 metres) and offers optimal comfort to passengers, whatever the length of the journey. The train is both ecological and economical due to its low energy consumption, its compliance with the latest emissions standards in thermal mode and its reduced maintenance costs. Coradia Polyvalent is the first French regional train to comply with all European standards, in particular with regard to access for people with reduced mobility.\nTo date, 348 Coradia Polyvalent trains have been ordered as part of the contract awarded to Alstom by SNCF in October 2009, including 287 Coradia Polyvalent for Régiolis by 9 French regions and 61 Coradia Liner by the French state, the authority responsible for the country’s TET (intercity) trains. Régiolis has already covered more than 50 million kilometres in commercial service.\nThe Coradia Polyvalent train also meets the needs of the export market: 17 trains have been ordered by SNTF (Algeria) and 15 trains by APIX (Senegal).\nThe manufacture of Coradia Polyvalent involves more than 4,000 jobs in France at Alstom and its suppliers.

Deliveries will take place between October and December 2020.\nThis new order comprises 2 dual-mode and 3 electric Régiolis, in their comfortable suburban version, to reinforce the region’s entire regional fleet. These new Coradia Polyvalent trains will benefit from the same characteristics as those already in circulation in the region. Consisting of four cars each, the trains have 50% more access doors than the regional and intercity versions, facilitating passenger flows. At the region’s request, the trains benefit from specific equipment such as automatic passenger counting, spaces for bicycles and frontal display of destinations. \nThe first Coradia Polyvalent trains for Occitanie entered commercial service in May 2014 on the lines linking Toulouse to Latour-de-Carol and Mazamet.\n“Alstom is proud of this new mark of confidence from the region of Occitanie. The expertise and innovation capacities of our French teams are poised to support the region’s modernisation plan for the regional TER rail lines, for the benefit of the passengers. This order also contributes to the activity of Alstom’s sites located in this region, particularly in Tarbes and Toulouse,” says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President France at Alstom.\n\"My commitment to rail requires a proactive investment in the renewal of rolling stock. With our regional public transport service liO, we are proving that rail is a mode of transport of the future. In addition to our efforts to ensure the sustainability of smaller lines, we are investing heavily to improve users\' travel conditions. And the result is there: the number of passengers is increasing in Occitania. Since 2016, the Region has mobilised nearly €130 million to acquire 18 Régiolis trains. This order is also a strong signal to our regional industry, and in particular to Alstom\'s sites in Toulouse and Tarbes, which fully contribute to the economic dynamics of Occitania,\" said Carole Delga, President of Occitania region.\nCoradia Polyvalent belongs to Alstom\'s Coradia range of trains. With its modular architecture, it can be adapted to the requirements of each public transport authority as well as to different types of use: suburban, regional and intercity. It comes in three lengths (56, 72 or 110 metres) and offers optimal comfort to passengers, whatever the length of the journey. The train is both ecological and economical due to its low energy consumption, its compliance with the latest emissions standards in thermal mode and its reduced maintenance costs. Coradia Polyvalent is the first French regional train to comply with all European standards, in particular with regard to access for people with reduced mobility.\nTo date, 338 Coradia Polyvalent trains have been ordered as part of the contract awarded to Alstom by SNCF in October 2009, including 277 Coradia Polyvalent for Régiolis by 9 French regions and 61 Coradia Liner by the French state, the authority responsible for the country’s TET (intercity) trains. Régiolis has already covered more than 50 million kilometres in commercial service.\nThe Coradia Polyvalent train also meets the needs of the export market: 17 trains have been ordered by SNTF (Algeria) and 15 trains by APIX (Senegal).\nThe manufacture of Coradia Polyvalent secures more than 4,000 jobs in France for Alstom and its suppliers. Six of Alstom\'s 12 sites in France are involved in the project: Reichshoffen for the design and assembly, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction chains, Villeurbanne for the on-board computerised systems and signalling products, and Saint-Ouen for the design.',NULL,NULL,1),(1335,'Alstom','Inauguration of Alstom’s new-generation Citadis tram for the Urban Community of Caen la Mer','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/7/inauguration-alstoms-new-generation-citadis-tram-urban-community-caen-la','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/07/27/20190320_111150_%C2%A9Alstom.jpg?itok=BFp4VKW2','27 Jul 2019','2023-09-20 17:39:18','Press contact France - North/North-West \n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Marion Verny\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,27 July 2019 – Alstom has commissioned its new-generation Citadis X05 tram on the three new lines of Caen la Mer. Presided over by Joël Bruneau, President of the Urban Community of Caen la Mer, and Rodolphe Thomas, First Vice-President of Caen la Mer, in charge of transport, travel and infrastructure, the inauguration took place in the presence of Jean-Léonce Dupont, President of Calvados region, Hervé Morin, President of Normandy region, Agnès Monfret, EU delegate, Stéphane Guyon, general Secretary of Calvados Prefecture and Emmanuel Bois, Sales Director for Alstom in France.\n“Just one year after the first tram was presented at the La Rochelle site, it is with great pride that Alstom and its teams take part in this inauguration. Thanks to their reliability, availability and ease of maintenance, we have total confidence in the ability of the 26 Citadis trams to meet the growing mobility requirements of the inhabitants of the Urban Community of Caen la Mer,” says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President France at Alstom.\n33 metres long and featuring 6 double doors on each side, the Citadis X05 for Caen la Mer can carry more than 210 passengers. It has 6 extra-wide passenger information screens, large windows covering 45% of the vehicle and will offer USB charging sockets, a first in France. In addition, the Citadis X05 for the Urban Community of Caen la Mer can climb slopes with gradients of up to 8% and has standardised, proven and more accessible components. Last but not least, the tram demonstrates a particularly high level of performance in terms of environmental sustainability, thanks in particular to its 100% LED lighting and optimised air conditioning. It is particularly energy efficient and 95% recyclable.\nEight of Alstom\'s 13 sites in France designed and manufactured the Citadis trams for the Urban Community of Caen la Mer: La Rochelle (design, assembly, validation, commercial entry into service and warranty), Ornans (engines), Le Creusot (bogies), Tarbes (traction modules), Valenciennes (interior layout), Villeurbanne (on-board computerised systems), Aix en Provence (tachymetry, for measuring travel speed) and Saint-Ouen (design).In total, more than 2,600 Citadis trams have been sold to more than 50 cities in 20 countries.',NULL,NULL,1),(1336,'Alstom','Alstom Q1 2019/20 Orders and Sales','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/7/alstom-q1-201920-orders-and-sales','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/07/17/20190718_Infographic_Q1_2019_EN.png?itok=AlLmbzOL','18 Jul 2019','2023-09-20 17:39:22','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,Level of orders intake of €1.6 billion\nSales level at €2.1 billion, up 2% \nOutlook confirmed\n \n18 July 2019 – Over the first quarter of fiscal year 2019/20 (from 1 April to 30 June 2019), Alstom booked €1.6 billion of orders, compared to €2.6 billion over the same period last year. The Group’s sales increased to €2.1 billion, up 2% (+1% organic) compared to €2.0 billion over the first quarter of 2018/19.\nAt €40 billion on 30 June 2019, the current backlog provides strong visibility on future sales.\nKey figures\n\nActual figures\n(in € million)\n\n\n2018/19\nQ1\n\n\n2019/20\nQ1\n\n\n% change\nreported\n\n\n% change\norganic\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOrders received\n\n\n2,641\n\n\n1,620\n\n\n(39)%\n\n\n(39)%\n\n\n \n\n\nSales\n\n\n2,017\n\n\n2,054\n\n\n 2%\n\n\n1%\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeographic and product breakdowns of reported orders and sales are provided in Appendix 1.

We also successfully delivered two important projects: the first Coradia Stream “Pop” train in Italy and the Sydney North West Metro. This demonstrates the strengths of Alstom in terms of smart and green innovation as well as efficient delivery, two pillars of our newly launched Alstom in Motion Strategic plan.” said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n***\nDetailed review\nDuring the first quarter of 2019/20, Alstom recorded €1.6 billion of orders, with a large Rolling stock orders intake in Europe, notably in Germany with a major contract of Coradia iLint trains for the Hessen region and for the Hamburg metro, in France with Coradia Polyvalent trains, and in both Netherlands and Italy with additional Coradia Stream trains. The group was also awarded Signalling contracts in Europe and Asia-Pacific. The Q1 2019/20 order book compares to last year’s Q1 orders of €2.6bn which included the large contract for the Montreal driverless light metro system.\nSales, at €2.1 billion, were up 2% (+1% organic) in the first quarter 2019/20, compared to the same period last year, with a decrease in Systems balanced by a notable growth in Signalling and Rolling stock. Sales were mainly fuelled by system projects in the Middle East, rolling stock contracts in Europe mainly with the Coradia product family delivering sales in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands and the Amtrak contract in the US.\nMain events\nIn May 2019, the Sydney North West Metro line delivered by Alstom entered into commercial service. It represents Australia’s biggest public transport project and the first fully automated metro project in the country, with one million commuters travelling the line within two weeks.  \nIn June 2019, the first three regional Coradia Stream “Pop” trains, out of a total of 47 trains destined for Emilia Romagna, entered into passenger services. \nAlstom confirms the development of innovative products and its commitment towards more sustainable solutions with several orders over the quarter for Aptis ebuses in Paris, Grenoble and La Rochelle and a major order of Hydrogen Coradia iLint trains with RMV in Germany for the renewal of diesel trains. \nIn June 2019, after becoming the first French company to obtain the AFAQ ISO 37001 Anti-bribery certification for France and Europe in 2017, followed by Asia-Pacific in 2018, Alstom has obtained certification for its countries of operation in the regions of North America, Middle-East & Africa and Latin America.\nAlstom hosted on 24 June 2019 in Paris a Capital Markets Day for financial analysts and investors. During this event, Alstom presented its new strategic plan – AiM Alstom in Motion, as well as new financial objectives until 2023.\nOutlook\nThe Alstom outlook is provided at constant perimeter and exchange rates. It is set in accordance with the IFRS 15 and 16 norms.\nThe 2019/20 fiscal year will be a year of stabilisation of growth after a 2018/19 fiscal year with an exceptional sales and profitability growth. For 2019/20 fiscal year, the business cycle with the finalisation of major systems contracts and the evolution of large Rolling stock projects will lead to a sales and margin growth lower than the average objectives set in the context of AiM, and to a working capital evolution impacting the generation of free cash flow.\nUp to March 2023, Alstom targets an average annual growth rate of sales around 5% over the period 2019/20 – 2022/23, an adjusted EBIT margin[1] to reach around 9% in 2022/23, a conversion from net income[2] to free cash flow above 80% by 2022/23[3] and a dividend policy with a pay-out ratio between 25% and 35%.\nFurthermore, Alstom will conduct a disciplined investment and external growth transactions policy to support its development and to create value.\n[1] Including the share of net income of the joint venture with CASCO held by Alstom at 49%\n[2] Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent\n[3] The free cash flow generation is subject to usual short-term volatility linked to customers down payments and milestone payments from customers\n***\nAppendix 1a – Geographic Breakdown\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements which are based on current plans and forecasts of Alstom’s management.

Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.\nOrder backlog\nOrder backlog represents sales not yet recognised on orders already received. \nOrder backlog at the end of a financial year is computed as follows:\norder backlog at the beginning of the year;\nplus new orders received during the year;\nless cancellations of orders recorded during the year;\nless sales recognised during the year.\nOrder backlog corresponds to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, as per IFRS15 standard quantitative and qualitative disclosures requirements.\nBook-to-Bill\nThe book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period. \nAdjusted EBIT\nWhen Alstom’s new organisation was implemented in 2015, adjusted EBIT (“aEBIT”) became the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors. \nGoing forward (1st application for Half Year 2019/2020 publication), Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered as part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities), namely the CASCO Joint Venture. The company believes that bringing visibility over a key contributor to the Alstom signalling strategy will provide a fairer and more accurate picture of the overall commercial & operational performance of the Group. This change will also enable more comparability with what similar market players define as being part of their main non-GAAP ‘profit’ aggregate disclosure.\naEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements: \n- net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs);\n- tangibles and intangibles impairment;\n- capital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;\n- any other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business;\n- and including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments.\nA non-recurring item is a “one-off” exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.\nAdjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT in percentage of sales.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash ﬂow is deﬁned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. In particular, free cash ﬂow does not include the proceeds from disposals of activity.\nThe most directly comparable financial measure to free cash flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities. \nAlstom uses the free cash ﬂow both for internal analysis purposes as well as for external communication as the Group believes it provides accurate insight regarding the actual amount of cash generated or used by operations.\nNet cash/(debt)\nThe net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, other current financial assets and non-current financial assets directly associated to liabilities included in financial debt, less financial debt. \nPay-out ratio\nThe pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the \"Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent” as presented in the consolidated income statement.\nOrganic basis \nFigures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro. The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.\n \n\nQ1 2018/19\n\n \n\nQ1 2019/20\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\nActual\n			figures\n\n\nExchange\n			rate\n\n\nScope\n			impact\n\n\nComparable\n			Figures\n\n \n\nActual\n			figures\n\n\nScope\n			Impact\n\n\nComparable\n			Figures\n\n \n\n% Var Act.\n\n\n% Var Org.\n\n\nOrders\n\n\n2,641\n\n\n33\n\n\n-\n\n\n2,675\n\n\n \n\n\n1,620\n\n\n \n\n\n1,620\n\n\n \n\n\n(39)%\n\n\n(39)%\n\n\nSales\n\n\n2,017\n\n\n26\n\n\n-\n\n\n2,043\n\n\n \n\n\n2,054\n\n\n \n\n\n2,054\n\n\n \n\n\n2%\n\n\n1%',NULL,NULL,1),(1337,'Alstom','Alstom to supply core train systems for first driverless metro line in Nanjing, China','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/7/alstom-supply-core-train-systems-first-driverless-metro-line-nanjing','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/07/16/_LS_0203_.jpg?itok=G8dzWHFl','17 Jul 2019','2023-09-20 17:39:31','Press contacts - China\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Li Wang\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email,17 July 2019 – Alstom has signed a contract with Nanjing Metro to provide traction systems and the train control and monitoring system (TCMS) for 318 metro cars that will run on Nanjing Line 7, the first driverless metro line in the Chinese city. Alstom, with its global experience in unattended train operation (UTO), will also provide technical review for the system. The value of the contract is nearly €50 million. \nAlstom will provide the OptONIX traction system, which was developed specifically for the Chinese market. Alstom’s joint venture, Shanghai Alstom Transport Electrical Equipment Co. Ltd. (SATEE), will manufacture the traction systems with support from Alstom sites in Belgium, France and India. Alstom’s joint venture in Xi’an, Xi’an Alstom Yongji Electric Equipment Co., Ltd will supply the traction motors.\nNanjing Line 7 is a key metro line in Nanjing’s metro network. 35 kilometres long with 27 stations, it connects the southwest to the northeast of the city. According to the long-term metro network development plan of Nanjing, Line 7 will have interchange stations with 11 metro lines in the future.  \n“This contract confirms Alstom’s leading role in driverless metros in China. This role stems from the performance of 28 driverless metro projects around the world, including seven in China.

The order was placed by Toulon transport operator RMTT via CATP, the French central procurement office for public transport. Delivery of the first of these 12-metre long, 3-door buses is scheduled for the end of 2019, expanding the Toulon metropolitan area’s own fleet of vehicles.\n“We are proud of the trust placed in us by the Toulon Provence Méditerranée metropolitan area with the largest order for electric buses in southern France. Aptis has also been chosen to reveal the new visual identity that all Mistral network vehicles will be adopting. This is a great honour for us,” said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President for Alstom in France.\nThanks to its innovative design, Aptis offers an unparalleled passenger experience. Its berthing system for perfect alignment with the pavement, its full low floor and wide double doors allow easy circulation and convenient boarding for people with reduced mobility and prams. Equipped with large bay windows along its entire length, Aptis offers 25% more windows than a standard bus and a rear seating area with panoramic views of the city. \nThe vehicles requested by Toulon are designed for slow charging, at night at the depot. Aptis is also available for occasional recharging at the end of each line, using ground-based charging solutions (SRS) or charging via pantograph. \nAptis was designed to have an optimised total cost. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of standard buses. The aim for the local authorities, therefore, is to have a total cost equivalent to that of existing standard diesel buses.\nAptis has already been selected by the Strasbourg transport operator CTS, RATP and Ile-de-France Mobilités, as well as by Greater Grenoble and Greater La Rochelle. As of September 2018, it is also referenced by the CATP, for public procurement by local authorities. This referencing allows member authorities to order Aptis vehicles directly and simply from the CATP, as the Toulon metropolitan area has just done, without having to embark on long and costly procedures. \nSince the prototype was presented in March 2017, more than 40,000 kilometres have been covered in real operating conditions by four test vehicles in France[1] and in Europe[2]. These trials made it possible to test the features of Aptis, inspired by the tram, in a new context, its insertion performance[3], its capacity for autonomy, and its driving assistance system. Aptis won the Innovation Award at the Busworld trade show in 2017. It also received the official certificate Origine France Garantie in January 2019. This certificate guarantees that more than 60% of Aptis\' added value is French.\nThe manufacturing and testing will be carried out at Alstom\'s two sites in Alsace. The Hangenbieten site is responsible for manufacturing the end modules (driver\'s cabin and rear seating area); the manufacture of the central passenger module, final assembly and tests will be carried out at the Reichshoffen site. This plan will enable serial production from the third quarter of 2019, drawing on the expertise of the teams and using the production facilities and surfaces available on each site.\nFive other Alstom sites in France are involved in the design and manufacture of Aptis: Saint-Ouen for the system integration, Tarbes for the traction, Ornans for the motors and Villeurbanne for the electronic components of the traction chain.

This order confirms that customers and passengers are satisfied with our vehicles and will continue to rely on the DT5 trains in the future. With this order we will have delivered a total of 163 vehicles to Hamburg. This is a proof of our long-standing, trusting and sustainable cooperation with Hochbahn”, says Dr. Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director for Alstom in Germany and Austria.\nThe DT5 metro fleet has been in operation in Hamburg since autumn 2012. The Hochbahn has now ordered a total of 163 metro trains of this generation in order to cope with the increasing number of passengers in the city. In the past, Alstom had already delivered the DT2, DT3 and DT4 fleets - a total of 462 trains - to the Hamburg subway system.\nHamburg is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. In order to meet the needs of such a large urban population, the DT5 was designed as a modern, spacious subway with wide corridors, a continuous interior and multi-purpose areas adapted to new passenger needs. Each of the 40 meter long three-car trains has 96 seats, 240 standing spaces and two additional wheelchair spaces. The DT5 also offers high passenger comfort, such as air conditioning, passenger information and monitoring systems as well as automatic door closing.\nThe DT5 subways are environmentally friendly. Their lightweight stainless steel car bodies and regenerative braking system contribute to improving energy efficiency. The vehicles are very quiet, which makes the Hamburg subway one of the quietest in the world. \nAs part of the Hamburg Senate\'s bidding offensive, Hochbahn is expanding its range of services by an average of around five percent per year over the next three years. The new services include significantly tighter metro intervals and a massive expansion of the bus service with new express and area buses.

Aptis will offer a new transport experience that meets the expectations of our customers and their users,\" declared David Journet, President of Alstom Aptis.\nThe vehicles requested by La Rochelle are designed for slow charging, at night at the depot. Aptis is also available for occasional recharging at the end of each line, using ground-based charging solutions (SRS) or charging through the top (pantograph).\nAptis was designed to have an optimised total cost. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of standard buses.  The aim for the local authorities, therefore, is to have a total cost equivalent to that of existing standard diesel buses.\nAlready chosen by the Strasbourg transport operator CTS, RATP and Ile-de-France Mobilités, as well as by the areas of Greater Grenoble and Greater Toulon, Aptis is also, as of September 2018, referenced by the CATP in its electric bus offer destined for public purchasing by local authorities. This referencing allows member authorities to order Aptis vehicles directly and simply from the CATP without having to embark on long and costly procedures.\nSince the prototype was presented in March 2017, more than 50,000 kilometres have been covered in real operating conditions by four test vehicles in France [1] and in Europe[2]. These trials made it possible to test the features of Aptis, inspired by the tram, in a new context, its insertion performance[3], its capacity for autonomy, and its driving assistance system. Aptis won the Innovation Award at the Busworld trade show in 2017. It also received the official certificate Origine France Garantie in January 2019. This certificate guarantees that more than 60% of Aptis\' added value is French.\nThe manufacturing and testing will be carried out at Alstom\'s two sites in Alsace. The Hangenbieten site is responsible for manufacturing the end modules (driver\'s cabin and rear seating area); the manufacture of the central passenger module, final assembly and tests will be carried out at the Reichshoffen site. This plan will enable serial production from the third quarter of 2019, drawing on the expertise of the teams and using the production facilities and surfaces available on each site.\nFive other Alstom sites in France are involved in the design and manufacture of Aptis: Saint-Ouen for the system integration, Tarbes for the traction, Ornans for the motors and Villeurbanne for the electronic components of the traction chain. Finally, Alstom’s site in Vitrolles is developing one of the charging solutions (SRS).\n[1] Paris (RATP lines 21 and 147), Lyon, Strasbourg, Marseille, La Rochelle, Nantes, Le Mans, Orléans, Versailles, Lourdes, Toulon, Tarbes, Grenoble, Montpellier and Nice.\n[2] Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy.\n[3] Optimised use of surface area in turns (-25% compared to a conventional bus)',NULL,NULL,1),(1349,'Alstom','Alstom presents its new strategic plan and objectives for 2023','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/6/alstom-presents-its-new-strategic-plan-and-objectives-2023','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/08/Global/OneAlstomPlus/Railsystems/Pressreleases/20160129---155489-MedRes-AlstomHeadquartersinSaintOuenFrance-MG7200A---377x320.jpg?itok=SMT4CmMr','24 Jun 2019','2023-09-20 17:40:34','PDF - 7.03 MB\n      24/06/2019 Capital Markets Day: presentation\n    \n    \n      \n        24/06/2019 Capital Markets Day: presentation',NULL,NULL,1),(1350,'Alstom','Alstom supplies ETCS for maintenance vehicles in Switzerland','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/6/alstom-supplies-etcs-maintenance-vehicles-switzerland','','21 Jun 2019','2023-09-20 17:40:38','',NULL,NULL,1),(1351,'Alstom','Alstom to deliver eight Coradia Lint regional trains to ODEG in Germany','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/6/alstom-deliver-eight-coradia-lint-regional-trains-odeg-germany','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/06/18/ODEG.jpg?itok=ErgZ5cC3','20 Jun 2019','2023-09-20 17:40:44','Press contacts - Germany\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Andreas Flórez\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Jörn Bischoff\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,20 June 2019 - Alstom has received an order for the delivery of eight Coradia Lint regional trains from Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn GmbH (ODEG).

SEMITAG, the Grenoble public transport operator, has placed an order for 7 Aptis via the CATP, the French central procurement office for public transport. The first deliveries of these 12-metre-long buses equipped with 3 doors are scheduled for the end of 2019. They will be the first electric buses to form part of the public transport network around Grenoble.\n\"We are honoured by the confidence demonstrated in us once again by CATP and SEMITAG. Grenoble was one of the first to reintroduce the fully accessible tram to France and had already chosen Alstom to provide it with more than 100 tram sets. This order is a new sign of trust and points to the relationship of true partnership and proximity fostered between the teams in Grenoble and Alstom over the years,\" said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Senior Vice President Alstom in France.\nThanks to its innovative design, Aptis offers an unparalleled passenger experience. Its berthing system for perfect alignment with the pavement, its low, completely flat floor and wide double doors allow easy circulation and convenient boarding for people with reduced mobility and prams. Equipped with large bay windows along its entire length, Aptis offers 25% more windows than a standard bus, and a rear seating area with panoramic views of the city.\nThe vehicles requested by Grenoble are designed for slow charging, at night in the depot. Aptis is also available for charging at the end of each line whenever necessary, using ground-based charging solutions (SRS) or charging through the top (by pantograph). For this contract, the batteries are leased to allow a lower initial investment for the customer and to guarantee the best technology throughout the lifecycle.\nAptis was designed to have an optimised total cost. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of standard buses. The aim for the local authorities, therefore, is to have a total cost equivalent to that of existing standard diesel buses.\nAlready chosen by CTS, the Strasbourg transport operator, as well as by RATP and Ile-de-France Mobilités, Aptis is also, as of September 2018, referenced by the CATP in its electric bus offer destined for public purchasing by local authorities. This referencing allows member authorities to order Aptis vehicles directly and simply from the CATP without having to embark on long and costly procedures, as Grenoble has just done.\nSince the prototype was presented in March 2017, more than 40,000 kilometres have been covered in real operating conditions by four test vehicles in France[1] and in Europe[2]. These trials have made it possible to test the features of Aptis, inspired by the tram, in a new context, its insertion performance[3], its capacity for autonomy, and its driving assistance system. Aptis won the Innovation Award at the Busworld trade show in 2017. It also received the official certificate Origine France Garantie in January 2019. This certificate guarantees that more than 60% of Aptis\' added value is French.\nManufacturing and testing will be carried out at Alstom\'s two sites in Alsace.

Now the winner has been determined: The French manufacturer Alstom will deliver the vehicles of type Coradia iLint by the timetable change in 2022. In addition to the trains, the order also includes the supply of hydrogen, maintenance and the provision of reserve capacities for the next 25 years. Alstom offers the supply of hydrogen in cooperation with Infraserv GmbH & Co. Höchst KG, with the filling station being located on the premises of the Höchst industrial park. \n“The purchase of 27 vehicles is a lighthouse project for fuel cell mobility, about which I’m very pleased,” says Enak Ferlemann, Parliamentary State Secretary of the German Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure. “The federal government supports this investment in climate-friendly mobility by assuming 40 percent of the additional vehicle costs incurred in comparison to diesel vehicles, as well as by providing proportional support for the hydrogen filling station. The project can serve as a model for the German transport ministry. We hope that many other projects in Germany will follow this example.” \nWorld’s largest fleet of fuel cell trains\n“On Hesse’s tracks you can still find many diesel vehicles today as overhead lines are missing. Fuel cell traction is therefore a quickly feasible alternative to expensive electrification,” says Tarek Al-Wazir, Hesse’s Minister of Transport. \"In Hessen, transport is responsible for one third of greenhouse gas emissions. Steam instead of diesel soot is therefore an exciting approach. We will continue to actively support the project and make every effort to ensure that the necessary adaptations to the rail infrastructure around the hydrogen filling station in Höchst make rapid progress.\"\n\"This award sets two records: With the commissioning of the new vehicles in 2022, RMV will have the world\'s largest fleet of fuel cell trains in passenger transport and it is the largest order in the history of our subsidiary fahma,\" says RMV Managing Director Prof. Knut Ringat. \"After electrically powered trains, electric buses and hydrogen buses, we are now offering our passengers a further opportunity to travel without emissions. This milestone makes me proud and is a giant step towards a mobility without pollutants\". \nThis order is also of great importance to Dr. Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director of Alstom in Germany and Austria: “We are very pleased that Alstom’s zero-emission Coradia iLint regional trains will be operated in Hesse in the near future, allowing climate friendly transportation of passengers in the Taunus region. This new success, coupled with Coradia iLint’s previous success, demonstrates how trendsetting and sustainable transportation is already a reality.”\nThe new fuel cell trains will replace the existing diesel-powered trains on the following lines: RB11 (Frankfurt-Höchst – Bad Soden), RB12 (Frankfurt – Königstein), RB15 (Frankfurt – Bad Homburg – Brandoberndorf) and RB16 (Friedrichsdorf – Friedberg).  The total order value amounts to around 500 million euros.\nRefueling in the Höchst industrial park\nThe new trains will be refuelled at Industriepark Höchst. Dr. Joachim Kreysing, Managing Director of Infraserv Höchst, the operator of Industriepark Höchst, is delighted that the site will play an important role in the further development of this forward-looking technology: “With its existing hydrogen infrastructure, Industriepark Höchst is an ideal filling station location for fuel-cell vehicles. The operation of the hydrogen filling station for trains as a supplement to the tanking facilities for buses and trucks fits in perfectly with our concept, with which we as an innovative company are further developing our energy supply concepts and are relying on environmentally friendly energy carriers”\nFor Hochtaunuskreis District Administrator Ulrich Krebs, the fuel cell trains in the Taunus network are a reasonable alternative. \"In addition to electrifying the S5 to Usingen, the fuel cell trains offer various advantages for routes that have not yet been electrified,\" says Krebs, who is also deputy chairman of the RMV supervisory board. \"Commuters benefit from more space in the trains and a significantly quieter journey because the engine noise of the vehicles is quieter due to the electric drive. This is also an advantage for the people living near the lines.\"\nWorld’s first passenger train powered by hydrogen\nCoradia iLint is the world’s first passenger train powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which produces electrical power for traction. The trains are as silent as a suburban train and are locally emission-free as they only emit steam and liquid water into the environment.\nIn addition, this type of vehicle is characterized by several innovations: clean energy conversion, flexible energy storage in batteries as well as intelligent management of traction power and available energy, combined with appropriate driver assistance systems. Specially developed for the use on non-electrified lines, the Coradia iLint allows clean, sustainable train operation while maintaining high performance and economic use for its customers.\n160 seats per vehicle\nThe world’s first two hydrogen trains have already been in regular passenger service in the Elbe-Weser network in Lower Saxony since September 2018. The Local Transport Authority of Lower Saxony (Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen, LNVG) will operate 14 Coradia iLint trains on that line from 2021. RMV is therefore the second operator to embrace environmentally-friendly hydrogen technology without exhaust gases, using the vehicles provided by fahma.  \nAll 27 new fuel cell trains will be equipped with comprehensive passenger information systems, such as monitors with real-time information. Moreover, they will be provided with space for bicycles, wheelchairs and prams and will offer complimentary WiFi access to passengers during their journey. The new trains will provide 160 seats so that the capacity of the lines in the Taunus subnetwork will be increased by up to 40 percent, especially for commuter trains in rush-hour traffic.',NULL,NULL,1),(1369,'Alstom','Alstom to attend Transport Logistic 2019 in Munich','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/5/alstom-attend-transport-logistic-2019-munich','','20 May 2019','2023-09-20 17:42:09','Locomotives\n      \n      Prima H3 & Prima H4: Shunting with an eco-friendly attitude',NULL,NULL,1),(1370,'Alstom','Alstom’s Aptis is selected in the context of Europe’s largest tender for electric buses','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/5/alstoms-aptis-selected-context-europes-largest-tender-electric-buses','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/05/20/Alstom_Aptis_2019.jpg?itok=YKWRfn3l','20 May 2019','2023-09-20 17:42:13','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - France Great East\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Arnaud Zeisser\n      \n              Send an email,20 May 2019 - Alstom is one of the three winners of the largest European call to tender for electric buses launched by the RATP and 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. The first firm tranche is for 50 buses. The amount of the framework contract could reach 133 million euros. These Aptis buses, 12 metres long, will play a role in the massive renewal of the bus fleet of the Île-de-France network. This order follows that of CTS, the Strasbourg transport company, for 12 vehicles.\nThanks to its innovative design, Aptis offers an unparalleled passenger experience. Its berthing system for perfect alignment with the pavement, its fully low and completely flat floor and wide double doors permit easy circulation and convenient boarding for people with reduced mobility and prams. Equipped with large bay windows, Aptis offers 25% more windowed surfaces than a standard bus, and a seating area at the back with panoramic views of the city.\n\"We are very proud to be involved in making the Île-de-France region a global reference in clean urban road transport. This tender is major and key for Aptis, our 100% electric mobility solution designed by Alstom\'s teams at the Hangenbieten and Reichshoffen sites in Alsace. We are delighted by the confidence shown in us by the RATP and Île-de-France Mobilités,\" says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\nThe vehicles ordered by the RATP are designed for slow charging, at night in the depot. Aptis is also available for charging at the end of each line whenever necessary, using ground-based charging solutions (SRS) or charging through the top.\nAptis was designed to have an optimised total cost. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of a standard bus. Its total cost of ownership is equivalent to that of a current standard diesel bus over a 20-year period.\nSince September 2018, Aptis is also referenced by the CATP, the French central procurement office for public transport, in its electric bus offer destined for public purchasing by local authorities. This referencing allows member authorities to order Aptis vehicles directly and simply from the CATP, without the need for long and costly procedures.\nSince the prototype was presented in March 2017, more than 40,000 kilometres have been covered in real operating conditions by four test vehicles in France[1] and in Europe[2]. These trials have made it possible to test the characteristics of Aptis, inspired by the tram, in a new context, its insertion performances[3], its capacity for autonomy, and its driving assistance system. Aptis won the Innovation Award at the Busworld trade show in 2017. It also received the official certificate Origine France Garantie in January 2019. This certificate guarantees that more than 60% of Aptis\' added value is French.\nManufacturing and testing will be carried out at Alstom\'s two sites in Alsace. The Hangenbieten site is responsible for manufacturing the end modules (driver\'s cabin and rear seating area); the manufacture of the central passenger module, final assembly and tests will be carried out at the Reichshoffen site. This plan will enable serial production from the third quarter of 2019, drawing on the expertise of the teams and using the production facilities and surfaces available on each site.\nFive other Alstom sites in France are involved in the design and manufacture of Aptis: Saint-Ouen for the system integration, Tarbes for the traction, Ornans for the motors and Villeurbanne for the electronic components of the traction chain. Finally, Alstom’s site in Vitrolles is developing one of the charging solutions (SRS).\n[1] Paris (RATP lines 21 and 147), Lyon, Strasbourg, Marseille, La Rochelle, Nantes, Le Mans, Orléans, Versailles, Lourdes, Toulon, Tarbes, Grenoble and Montpellier.\n[2] Belgium, Germany, Holland, Spain, Italy.\n[3] Optimised use of surface area in turns (-25% compared to a conventional bus)',NULL,NULL,1),(1371,'Alstom','Alstom unveils model of hydrogen train design at Railtex','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/5/alstom-unveils-model-hydrogen-train-design-railtex','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/05/28/Alstom%20Eversholt%20Rail%20breeze%20hydrogen%20train%20model%201.JPG?itok=DRobdDOG','14 May 2019','2023-09-20 17:42:17','Press contact United Kingdom & Ireland\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Kathryn Lancaster\n      \n              Send an email,14 May 2019 – Alstom have today unveiled an accurate scale model of the ‘breeze’, the new hydrogen train design for the UK market developed in partnership with Eversholt Rail. Measuring 1.2m long, the model showcases the minute design detail of the converted Class 321 trains, reengineering some of the UK’s most reliable rolling stock. These trains could run across the UK as early as 2022, emitting only water and no harmful emissions at all.  \nThe proven and reliable Class 321 is an excellent fit in terms of characteristics, fleet size and availability for conversion to a Hydrogen Multiple Unit (HMU). The innovative technical solution defined is the first to allow a hydrogen train to fit within the standard UK loading gauge, and it will also create more space for passengers than the trains they are intended to replace.\nThe Alstom facility in Widnes will manage the conversion of the ‘breeze’ trains, creating high quality engineering jobs in this new, emerging sector.  \nMike Muldoon, Alstom UK & Ireland Head of Business Development & Marketing, said:\n“I am delighted to be at Railtex unveiling this accurate scale model of the ‘breeze’. The momentum continues to build around hydrogen trains in the UK and we believe they have a key role to play in helping the railway meet Government targets to remove diesel trains by 2040.

The very strong sales growth and the further margin enhancement confirm the success of our 2020 strategy, which is now completed. \" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n***\nSuccess of the 2020 strategy and 2018/19 performance\nAlstom 2020 strategy is based on the five following pillars:\n1 - Customer-focused organisation\nThe Group booked €12,107 million orders in the fiscal year 2018/19. This compares to €7,183 million over the same period last year. \nAlstom was awarded projects in all regions, including an order for 100 next-generation very high speed trains in France, a driverless regional express train for Montreal, a metro maintenance contract for Riyadh, metro cars for the Grand Paris Express in France, regional trains in Luxembourg, trains and maintenance in Italy, a major rolling stock contract for Mumbai, an integrated metro system for Taipei, a long-term rolling stock and signalling maintenance contract for Sydney metro, a national on-board train control system in Norway, electric locomotives in Morocco and Citadis trams for Frankfurt. External orders for signalling were high at €1.5 bn representing a book to bill of 1.2. At €40.5 billion on 31 March 2019, current backlog provides strong visibility on future sales.\n2 - Complete range of solutions\nIn fiscal year 2018/19, Alstom’s total sales reached €8,072 million, up 10% (11% organically). \nSignalling, systems and services represented 57% of sales in 2018/19. Systems sales increased by around 16% with the progress of urban systems projects in the Middle East and Panama metro in Latin America. Services sales reached €1.6 billion, with notably the contribution of long-term contracts in the United Kingdom and Italy. Signalling sales amounted to €1.3 billion, with lower activity in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Rolling stock sales reached €3.4 billion with deliveries of regional and high-speed trains in Europe and the ramp-up of the Amtrak project in the USA. \n3 - Value creation through innovation\nAlstom sustained its level of research and development (gross costs) at €380 million, i.e. 4.7% of sales, in fiscal year 2018/19. Main programmes included the renewal of rolling stock ranges, execution of signalling R&D and the investment in Digital solutions. In September 2018, Alstom’s hydrogen trains Coradia iLint entered passenger service in Lower Saxony, a world premiere. In March 2019, Alstom also opened StationOne, the first online marketplace dedicated to the railway sector. Finally, the APTIS electric bus won its first contract in Strasbourg, France.\n4 - Operational and environmental excellence\nAlstom delivered an adjusted EBIT of €570 million in 2018/19, compared to €397 million the previous year, representing a 44% increase. The adjusted EBIT margin reached 7.1% for the fiscal year 2018/19, compared to 5.4% for the fiscal year 2017/18. This continued improvement was driven by volume increase, efficiencies in operational performance and a contained cost structure. During the fiscal year 2018/19, net income (Group share) amounted to €681 million, compared to €365 million the previous year, including exceptional net income from discontinued operations of €248 million linked to the transaction with General Electric.\nIn terms of environmental excellence, energy consumption is to be reduced by 20% for solutions and by 10% for operations by 2020. With the objective of constantly improving safety at work, the Group targets an occupational injury frequency rate[1] of 1 by 2020. Alstom has already reduced its energy consumption by 17% for solutions, by 13% for operation and this year reached its occupational injury frequency rate1 target of 1.1.    \nAlstom improved its score in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe indexes in 2018 with an overall score of 81 out of 100 in the DJSI ranking, which represents a one-point improvement compared to previous year. Alstom scored A- at CDP’s 2018 climate change questionnaire.\n5 - Diverse and entrepreneurial people\nTo reflect Alstom’s passenger base, the company has the ambition to increase diversity, aiming for 25% of Management or Professional roles to be occupied by women in 2020. In 2018/19, this indicator reached 21%.\nAlstom’s employees around the world all share the same culture, underpinned by strong integrity and ethics values. In June 2017, Alstom obtained ISO 37001 certification for its anti-bribery management system, confirming its commitment to fight corruption. Alstom also announced that the three-year period of self-reporting obligations that the Group agreed to as part of the Plea Agreement of 22 December 2014 has come to a successful completion. This achievement is the result of the company’s efforts during the period and a close cooperation with the US Department of Justice. The company remains committed to the highest level of integrity in its activities and will continue the development of its compliance programme.\n***\nSolid balance sheet\nDuring fiscal year 2018/19, the Group free cash flow was positive at €153 million, benefitting from positive EBIT evolution and impacted by phasing of transformation capex, working capital driven by ramp-up of major projects signed in previous years, as well as Siemens/Alstom deal costs impact.\nAlstom invested €207 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2018/19, compared to €203 million the previous year. As end of March 2019, the cumulated transformation capex stood at €269 million, out of €300 million, with notably the progress in sites’ construction in South Africa and in India. \nThe Group had a gross cash in hand of €3,432 million at the end of March 2019 and a fully undrawn credit line of €400 million. After reimbursement at maturity of a €371 million bond in October 2018, Alstom bond debt amounted to €878 million as end of March 2019. Alstom net cash included the sale of interests in the three Energy Joint Ventures to General Electric amounting to €2,325 million on 31 March 2019. Last, equity reached €4,159 million at 31 March 2019, versus €3,430 million at 31 March 2018.\n***\nDividend\nThe Board of Directors decided to propose a dividend of €5.50 per share to the Shareholder’s Meeting that will be held on 10 July 2019, given net cash position at 31 March 2019, positively impacted by the sales of interests of the three Energy Joint Ventures to General Electric for €2,594 million. \nThe ex-dividend date would be 15 July 2019 and the record date would be 16 July 2019. The dividend would be payable in cash from 17 July 2019.\n***\nOutlook\nThe Alstom outlook will be provided during a Capital Markets Day to be hosted in Paris on 24 June 2019.\nThe management report and the consolidated financial statements, as approved by the Board of Directors, in its meeting held on 6 May 2019, are available on Alstom’s website at www.alstom.com.

Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.\nOrder backlog\nOrder backlog represents sales not yet recognised on orders already received. \nOrder backlog at the end of a financial year is computed as follows:\norder backlog at the beginning of the year;\nplus new orders received during the year;\nless cancellations of orders recorded during the year;\nless sales recognised during the year.\n \nOrder backlog corresponds to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, as per IFRS15 standard quantitative and qualitative disclosures requirements.\nBook-to-Bill \nThe book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period. \nAdjusted EBIT\nWhen Alstom’s new organisation was implemented, adjusted EBIT (“aEBIT”) became the key performance indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.\naEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:\nnet restructuring expenses (including rationalisation costs); \ntangibles and intangibles impairment;\ncapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;\nand any other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realise business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business. \nA non-recurring item is a “one-off” exceptional item that is not supposed to be reappearing in following years and that is significant.\nAdjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT in percentage of sales.\nThe non-GAAP measure adjusted EBIT indicator reconciles with the GAAP measure EBIT as follows:\n\n \n\n\nYear ended\n\n\nYear ended\n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\n31 March 2018\n(rest.

In particular, free cash ﬂow does not include the proceeds from disposals of activity.\nThe most directly comparable financial measure to free cash flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities. \nA reconciliation of free cash ﬂow and net cash provided by operating activities is presented below: \n\n \n\n\nYear ended\n\n\nYear ended\n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\n31 March 2018\n(rest.

The innovative, 100% electric vehicle is already in Chile being prepared for a pilot within Red Metropolitana de Movilidad, the city’s metropolitan transport system, operated by Redbus Urbano, a Transdev’s subsidiary present in Chile since 2007. The pilot aims to demonstrate the bus’s benefits to the city’s travelers for a period of three months. It will be the first time that Aptis has been tested outside of Europe.\nIn 2017, Aptis was awarded the Innovation Award at Busworld, the main international bus fair. Aptis already been successfully tested in cities such as Paris, Versailles, Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille in France, Hamburg and Berlin in Germany, and Barcelona, Madrid and Vigo in Spain, among others, where it has stood out thanks to its tram-inspired design, its maneuverability and its outstanding passenger experience.\n“We are proud to bring to Chile this futuristic new solution for sustainable mobility, designed to meet the growing global demand for intelligent, inclusive, efficient and clean means of urban transport,” said Denis Girault, Managing Director of Alstom in Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia.\nIn March 2019, Alstom received the first order for Aptis: an order of 12 buses from the Strasbourg transport company CTS (Communauté des Transports Strasbourgeois).',NULL,NULL,1),(1380,'Alstom','Alstom’s innovative solutions for Line 2 of Panama Metro start commercial service','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/4/alstoms-innovative-solutions-line-2-panama-metro-start-commercial','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/04/26/IMG-20190426-WA0002.jpg?itok=eFK5x34U','26 Apr 2019','2023-09-20 17:43:05','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,26 April 2019 – Alstom, leader of Grupo de Empresas (GdE), celebrates together with Consorcio Linea 2 (formed by Odebrecht and FCC) the entry into commercial service of Line 2 of Panama Metro. The Group has been in charge of supplying an integrated metro system which includes 21 Metropolis trainsets as well as traction substations including Hesop reversible substation, and Urbalis – Alstom  Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) solution which controls the movement of the trains and enables trains to run at higher frequencies and speeds in total safety. \n\"We are honored and grateful to be providing an integrated system that both improves the operation of the metro line and reduces the environmental impact. As the commercial service starts, these technologies will allow the residents of Panama to have a reliable, comfortable and environmentally friendly means of transportation in the city\", said Ludovic d\'Hauthuille, Managing Director of Alstom North Latin America.\nIn order to optimize energy consumption, the electrical power supply system will be equipped with substations with Hesop technology, the Alstom solution for reversible substations that allows recovering and transferring more than 99% of the energy generated by the braking of the trains. This energy can be reused in the electrical network of the stations for services such as escalators, lighting and ventilation. The Hesop reversible substation is available and operational since 2015, in a wide range of voltage and power configurations. One hundred twenty-four Hesop substations have been installed in various railway networks, including the metros in Milan, Riyadh, London and Dubai, as well as the Sydney and Milan trams.\nAdditionally, Alstom’s CBTC Urbalis consists of a train control system based on radio communication, a proven and reliable signaling technology for metros. The Urbalis solution allows to precisely control the train path to efficiently and safely manage traffic.

The region has already ordered 33 Coradia Polyvalent for Régiolis since 2014, including a first entry into service. It thus brings its order up to 46 trains, representing a global investment of more than €330M.\nThe Occitanie region has ordered 5 dual-mode and 8 electric Régiolis, in their comfortable suburban version, to reinforce its entire regional fleet. Consisting of four cars each, these trains have 50% more access doors than the ‘regional\' and \'intercity\' versions, facilitating passenger flows. At the request of the region, these trains benefit from specific equipment such as automatic passenger counting, spaces reserved for bicycles, and frontal displays of destinations.\nThe first Coradia Polyvalent for Occitanie entered commercial service in May 2014 on the lines connecting Toulouse to Latour-de-Carol and Mazamet.\n\"This additional order is excellent news for the French railway industry and for Alstom’s sites in France. It marks the renewal of the Occitanie region\'s confidence in Alstom and its products,\" said Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom France.\n\"In Occitanie, we make rail a central element of our efforts to develop mobility in all the regions. As such, our investments to preserve and maintain the network are accompanied by a proactive approach to renewing the material, in a constant effort to improve the conditions of travel and quality of service offered to our 66,000 daily passengers,\" said Carole Delga, president of the Occitanie / Pyrénées-Méditerranée region.\n\"The arrival of these new Régiolis trains is an important step in enabling us to successfully develop the railway offer expected by the Occitanie region. This new material will enable us to continue modernising the trains to offer a quality of service in line with our customers’ expectations,\" said Jacques Rascol, Director of SNCF Mobilités Occitanie.\nCoradia Polyvalent belongs to Alstom’s Coradia range of trains. With its modular architecture, it can be adapted to the requirements of each public transport authority as well as to different types of use: suburban, regional and intercity. It comes in three lengths (56, 72 or 110 metres) and offers optimal comfort for passengers, whatever the length of the journey. The train is both ecological and economical due to its low energy consumption, its compliance with the latest emissions standards in thermal mode and its low maintenance costs. Pre-equipped to receive ERTMS[1] technology, Coradia Polyvalent is the first French regional train to comply with all European standards, in particular with regard to access for people with reduced mobility.\nTo date, 312 Coradia trains have been ordered as part of the contract awarded to Alstom by SNCF Mobilités in October 2009, including 251 Coradia Polyvalent and 61 Coradia Liners. Coradia Polyvalent trains have already covered more than 50 million kilometres in commercial service.\nThis train also meets the needs of the export market: 17 have been ordered by SNTF (Algeria) and 15 by APIX (Senegal).\nThe development and manufacture of Coradia Polyvalent trains secures more than 4,000 jobs in France for Alstom and its suppliers. Six out of the 12 Alstom sites in France are involved in the project: Reichshoffen for the design and assembly, Ornans for the engines, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction chains, Villeurbanne for the onboard IT systems and Saint-Ouen for the design.\n[1] European rail interoperability standard',NULL,NULL,1),(1391,'Alstom','Alstom will present its innovative hydrogen train at Exporail 2019','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/3/alstom-will-present-its-innovative-hydrogen-train-exporail-2019','','26 Mar 2019','2023-09-20 17:43:58','Press kit',NULL,NULL,1),(1392,'Alstom','The Italian tour of Aptis, Alstom\'s 100% electric bus, starts in Florence','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/3/italian-tour-aptis-alstoms-100-electric-bus-starts-florence','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/03/22/WhatsApp%20Image%202019-03-22%20at%2009.56.32.jpeg?itok=XSq2G9uK','22 Mar 2019','2023-09-20 17:44:02','Press contacts - Italy\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Gaia Mazzon\n      \n              Send an email,#iosonoaptis, a new mobility experience, in 6 Italian cities from March to May 2019\n22 March 2019 - Aptis, the 100% electric bus from Alstom, arrives in Italy to be presented to the Italian public, after Spain, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. The Italian tour of Aptis will start from Florence, where it was presented today in the splendid setting of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella. It will then leave for a trial tour across six Italian cities from March to May.\nDario Nardella Mayor of Florence, Vincenzo Ceccarelli Councilor for Transport of the Tuscany Region, Michele Viale Managing Director of Alstom in Italy and Stefano Bonora CEO of ATAF Gestioni, a company of the Busitalia group, technical partner of the Florence tour, were present at the launch conference and took part in the panoramic journey through the city center onboard Aptis\n“We are proud to start the Italian tour of Aptis from Florence, a city that is attentive to sustainable mobility. Aptis is an electric bus inspired by the world of trams and allows passengers to experience a unique comfort on board. We hope that the inhabitants and tourists of Florence will have the opportunity to appreciate this innovative e-bus, which will circulate for free in the streets of the city \"- said Michele Viale, Managing Director of Alstom in Italy.\nAptis will be in passenger service in the Tuscan capital, free of charge, for 13 days and will be operated in collaboration with ATAF. It will cover 7 different circuits, from the center to the periphery. Passengers will be able to express their appreciation of the travel experience by voting on board and on social media with selfies and messages for Aptis on the Twitter account: @Aptis_Alstom.\nSince the prototype was presented in March 2017, more than 40,000 kilometres have been covered in real operating conditions by four test vehicles in Europe. These trials have made it possible to test the characteristics of Aptis, inspired by the tram, in a new context, its insertion performances, its capacity for autonomy, and its driving assistance system. \nAptis, a bus inspired by the world of the tram, provides a unique comfort experience for passengers. Low floors throughout the vehicle and wide double doors allow smooth passenger flows and easy access for wheelchairs and pushchairs. Panoramic windows at the front and rear of the bus provide 20% more window surfaces than a conventional bus, as well as a lounge area at the rear.

The trains will be operated by Transdev subsidiary Bayerische Regiobahn GmbH (BRB) on the lines from Augsburg to Weilheim, Schongau, Ingolstadt, Eichstätt and Langenneufnach. The contract is worth over €150 million.\nThe trains will be built at Alstom’s site in Salzgitter, Lower Saxony, with delivery planned by September 2022. Thanks to this new contract, Alstom will be able to celebrate the production and delivery of the 1,000th Coradia Lint regional train – unquestionably the most successful diesel multiple unit (DMU) in Europe.\n“This order by Transdev is another great milestone in the history of our proven and popular Coradia Lint. It is symbolic that the 1,000th Coradia Lint will be operated by the very same transport company that operated the first Coradia Lint back in November 2000. This fortunate coincidence illustrates the train’s past and current performance and how the product meets the expectations of our customers and their passengers,” says Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director for Alstom in Germany and Austria.\nThe modern and environmentally friendly vehicles are powered by two 390 kW engines and reach a maximum operating speed of 140 km/h. The two-car trains can seat a total of 125 passengers and include a spacious area for the easy storage of bicycles. The trains boast an even higher level of comfort compared than the currently used trains and, by addressing the needs of people with limited mobility, the ability to offer all passengers travel with a minimum of constraints. \nAlstom\'s Coradia Lint trains have been operating in more than 30 networks in Germany, Europe and Canada since the year 2000. Thanks to continuous improvements, they offer the highest standard of safety, noise reduction and low emissions and can boast very high availability. The trains belong to Alstom\'s Coradia range of modular trains, which benefits from over 30 years of expertise and proven technical solutions and includes the world’s first hydrogen train, the Coradia iLint.

It concerns a contract for 12 Aptis, each one 12 metres long and equipped with three doors. These Aptis buses will be the first electric buses to reinforce CTS’s vehicle fleet.\nThanks to its innovative design, Aptis offers an unrivalled passenger experience. Its berthing system for perfect alignment with the pavement, its fully low and completely flat floor and wide double doors permit easy circulation and convenient boarding for people with reduced mobility and prams. Equipped with large bay windows along its entire length, Aptis offers 25% more windowed surfaces than a standard bus, and a rear seating area with panoramic views of the city.\n\"We are very proud to have received this first order for Aptis, our 100% electric mobility solution. Aptis is designed by the Alstom teams at Hangenbieten site in Alsace. We are delighted by the confidence shown in us by the CTS,\" says Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, President of Alstom in France.\nThe vehicles requested by Strasbourg are designed for slow charging, at night in the depot. Aptis is also available for charging at the end of each line whenever necessary, using solutions of ground-based charging (SRS) or charging through the top (inversed pantograph).\nAptis was designed with an optimised total cost in mind. This is possible thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs and a longer service life than that of a standard bus. For the local authorities, therefore, the goal is to have a total cost equivalent to that of existing standard diesel buses.\nSince September 2018, Aptis is also referenced by the CATP, the French central procurement office for public transport, in its electric bus offer destined for public purchasing by local authorities. This referencing allows member authorities to order Aptis vehicles directly and simply from the CATP, avoiding long and costly procedures.\nSince the prototype was presented in March 2017, more than 40,000 kilometres have been covered in real operating conditions by four test vehicles en France[1] and in Europe[2]. These trials have made it possible to test the characteristics of Aptis, inspired by the tram, in a new context, its insertion performances[3], its capacity for autonomy, and its driving assistance system.

Therefore, learning to detect and, above all, prevent diseases such as stroke, which in 90% of cases can be prevented, is key for us”, added José Antonio Rodríguez.\n  For Julio Agredano, President of the Freno al Ictus Association, “collaborating with companies such as Alstom, which are committed to the health of their employees, encourages us to proceed with our goal of reducing the impact of strokes in our country through our business network. This disease is quite unknown despite the fact that 45% of the work-related deaths are related to heart attacks or strokes”.\nLast year, Freno al Ictus Association visited Alstom offices in Spain several times  for training sessions and to raise awareness on the most frequent symptoms to detect strokes, what to do when it happens, and how to prevent it. Additionally, the company held an informative campaign on cerebrovascular health to over 2,000 professionals. \nStrokes are the second cause of death in Spain (the first in women), the first cause of acquired disability in adults and the second cause for dementia. According to the data of the Spanish Neurology Society (SEN), each year 120,000 people suffer from a stroke in our country, of which, 50% suffer from consequences, disabilities, or die. Currently, over 330,000 people have suffered from a stroke. 90% of strokes could have been avoided with appropriate risk-factor prevention and a healthy lifestyle.',NULL,NULL,1),(1409,'Alstom','GdE Consortium successfully operated the partial operation of the Panama Metro Line 2','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/1/gde-consortium-successfully-operated-partial-operation-panama-metro-line','','31 Jan 2019','2023-09-20 17:45:19','',NULL,NULL,1),(1410,'Alstom','Alstom signs MOU with Ajman University','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/1/alstom-signs-mou-ajman-university','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/01/30/MoU%20Pic.jpg?itok=-J_otM_0','30 Jan 2019','2023-09-20 17:45:25','Press contact: Middle East and Turkey\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Bahaa Omran \n      \n              Send an email,30 January 2019 – Alstom and Ajman University have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthen their mutual ties by organizing joint activities and events, exchanging expertise and knowledge, and sharing academic and professional capabilities.

Last year, Coradia Lint regional trains for the diesel networks Saxony-Anhalt and Augsburg, Coradia Continental regional trains for the Hessische Landesbahn, DT5 metros for Hamburg, Prima H3 locos and Coradia Nordic regional trains for Sweden left the plants on time and entered passenger service.\n„We are very proud of this top performance. Despite some challenges, our teams have performed excellently and strengthened the good relationships with our customers. In view of the vibrant market in the mobility industry, this is the basis that Alstom successfully brings to the future: excellence in execution and on-time delivery”, says Dr. Jörg Nikutta Managing Director for Alstom in Germany and Austria.\nIn December 2018, 54 Coradia Lint regional trains started to transport passengers on the non-electrified lines of Saxony-Anhalt connecting Magdeburg, the capital of the state, with the cities of Wolfsburg and Stendal in the north, Erfurt and Halle in the south, and Goslar in the west.28 Coradia Lint are also in service around Augsburg since December 2018 for the Transdev subsidiary Bayerische Regiobahn.\nIn December 2018, 30 Coradia Continental electric multiple units for the Hessische Landesbahn entered passenger service on the network South Hesse-Untermain.\nWith the last 18 Coradia Nordic regional trains delivered from Salzgitter to Skånetrafiken, the Swedish operator has increased its fleet to a total of 99 trains and operates since December 2018 one of the largest fleets in Sweden.\nIn addition, over 800 bogies were produced in Salzgitter last year.  \nAlstom employs around 3,000 people at 6 sites in Germany. Salzgitter, Alstom’s largest site worldwide, is one of Alstom’s competence centres for regional trains. The world’s first hydrogen-fuelled passenger train, Coradia iLint was developed by the engineering team of Salzgitter and manufactured at the site in Lower Saxony.

The hydrogen-fuel cell train is the first of its kind in the world. Alstom presents its ready-to-use hydrogen technology in six federal states, demonstrating an emission-free alternative for non-electrified lines. The roadshow will start in Rhineland-Palatinate and continue in Baden-Württemberg, Saxony, Thuringia, Berlin and Brandenburg.\n\"This roadshow is a great opportunity for passengers, media and political stakeholders to get to know our Coradia iLint hydrogen train. Our technology is ready for use. It represents an existing environment-friendly alternative for non- electrified or partially electrified lines and offers increased passenger comfort thanks to a significantly quieter train than a conventional diesel multiple unit \", says Dr. Jörg Nikutta Managing Director for Alstom in Germany and Austria.\nSince September 2018, the first two hydrogen trains from Alstom are in regular passenger service on the Elbe-Weser network. Starting in 2021, the Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen (LNVG) will use 14 Coradia iLints to transport regular travelers between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude with the environmentally friendly fuel cell trains.\nThe Coradia iLint is the world\'s first passenger train powered by a hydrogen fuel cell that generates electric power for traction. This completely emission-free train is quiet and only emits water vapor and condensation. The Coradia iLint features several innovations: clean energy conversion, flexible energy storage in batteries and intelligent management of power and available energy. Purpose-built for use on non-electrified lines, it enables clean, sustainable traction while maintaining high performance.\nThe Coradia iLint was developed by the Alstom teams in Salzgitter, Alstom\'s competence center for regional trains, and in Tarbes (France), Alstom\'s competence center for traction systems.',NULL,NULL,1),(1414,'Alstom','Alstom attains score of “A-” in CDP 2018  climate change questionnaire','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/1/alstom-attains-score-cdp-2018-climate-change-questionnaire','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/01/22/als199_dr2_099.jpg?itok=FHmzmnwH','22 Jan 2019','2023-09-20 17:45:41','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,22 January 2019 – Alstom has improved its score from “B” to “A-” in the CDP climate change questionnaire.

Orders in service were particularly positive with €1,452 million booked during the quarter.\nSales reached €2,010 million in the third quarter 2018/19, mainly fuelled by progress in the Dubai metro system project, deliveries of regional trains in Europe, as well as maintenance contract execution in the United Kingdom.\nMain events of the third quarter 2018/19\nIn November 2018, the Africa’s first high speed line was inaugurated in Morocco. Alstom supplied the Office National des Chemins de Fer Marocain (ONCF) with 12 very high-speed trains for the Tangier-Casablanca railway section. Alstom also supplied the level 1&2 on-board ERTMS for the trains.\nOn December 2018, the first train built in South Africa for PRASA was delivered on time and Alstom achieved a significant milestone by completing the last of the 22 Metropolis trains for Sydney Metro.\nOutlook\nThe Alstom outlook is provided at constant perimeter and exchange rate. It is set in accordance with the IFRS 15 standard, which is the new applicable standard for revenue recognition.\nFor the fiscal year 2018/19, sales are expected to reach around €8 billion and adjusted EBIT margin should reach around 7%. \nIn the medium term, Alstom should continue to outperform the market growth, gradually improve profitability, and improve cash generation, with possible volatility over some short periods.\nCreation of a global leader in Mobility\nThe proposed combination of Alstom with Siemens Mobility, including its rail traction drive business, has progressed in the last quarter. \nOn 12 December, Alstom and Siemens have jointly agreed to submit a remedy package on to the European Commission in response to its Statement of Objection of October 29.  Since then, the parties have had a continuous dialogue with the European Commission, including some improvement of the remedy package to respond to the European Commission concerns.  The proposed package represents the parties’ proposal to address the Commission’s concerns while preserving the industrial and economic value of the deal.\nThe proposed remedies include mainly signalling activities as well as rolling stock products and represent around four percent of the sales of the combined entity. The parties consider that the proposed remedy package is appropriate and adequate. There is, however, no certainty that the content of this package will be sufficient to alleviate the concerns of the Commission.

Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.\nOrder backlog\nOrder backlog represents sales not yet recognised on orders already received. \nOrder backlog at the end of a financial year is computed as follows:\norder backlog at the beginning of the year;\nplus new orders received during the year;\nless cancellations of orders recorded during the year;\nless sales recognised during the year.\nThe order backlog is also subject to changes in the scope of consolidation, contract price adjustments and foreign currency translation effects.\nBook-to-Bill \nThe book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period. \nAdjusted EBIT\nWhen Alstom’s new organisation was implemented, adjusted EBIT (“aEBIT”) became the key performance indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.\naEBIT corresponds to earning before interests, tax and net result from equity method investments adjusted with the following elements: \nnet restructuring expenses (including rationalisation costs); \ntangibles and intangibles impairment;\ncapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;\nand any other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realise business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business. \nA non-recurring item is a “one-off” exceptional item that is not supposed to be reappearing in following years and that is significant.\nAdjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT in percentage of sales.\nFree cash flow \nFree cash ﬂow is deﬁned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. In particular, free cash ﬂow does not include the proceeds from disposals of activity.\nThe most directly comparable financial measure to free cash flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities. \nOrganic basis \nFigures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro. The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.\n \n\n9 months 2017/18\n(rest.

Aptis will be tested together with local transport companies in Barcelona, Madrid and Vigo. The first operational test starts on January in Barcelona Metropolitan Area, before going to Madrid on the 4th of February. The roadshow will then continue in Vigo from 14 to 22 February. \n“We are pleased that Aptis is raising interest among Spanish cities with its ground-breaking features. This Spanish roadshow is a great opportunity to once again demonstrate Aptis unique insertion capacities within new urban environments. It wouldn’t have been possible without a real interest from the Spanish urban authorities for modern solutions serving tomorrow’s mobility ”, said Antonio Moreno, President of Alstom in Spain. \nThe tests conducted in the customer depots as well as under real operating conditions are designed to evaluate the specific characteristics of Aptis in a new urban setting, its charging system, its autonomy, and its insertion performance in traffic following the first successful tests in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and  Germany.\nAptis, a bus inspired by the world of the tram, provides a unique comfort experience for passengers. Low floors throughout the vehicle and wide double doors allow smooth passenger flows and easy access for wheelchairs and pushchairs. Panoramic windows at the front and rear of the bus provide 20% more window surfaces than a conventional bus, as well as a lounge area at the rear. \nThe vehicle fits perfectly into the urban environment thanks to its two steerable axles that minimize the turning radius and the footprint on the road (-25% compared to a conventional bus). This performance is an advantage especially at bus stops, where an automatic parking system has been developed, reducing the space required for parking (and therefore leaving extra space for other vehicles) and increasing accessibility for passengers. At night, Aptis can be recharged inside the depot. Alstom also provides a daytime charging solution at the end of each line. Rapid charging is carried out either via an inverted pantograph or via SRS, Alstom\'s innovative ground-based static charging system. Thanks to reduced maintenance and operating costs, and a longer service life than that of a bus (20 years), the total cost of ownership of Aptis is equivalent to that of today\'s diesel buses.',NULL,NULL,1),(1417,'Alstom','Alstom to continue maintenance of high-speed and suburban trains for Renfe in Spain','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/1/alstom-continue-maintenance-high-speed-and-suburban-trains-renfe-spain','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/01/15/flota_s1041.jpg?itok=-N33nbwk','15 Jan 2019','2023-09-20 17:45:55','Press contact - Samuel Miller\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller \n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - Spain and Portugal\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Irma Aguado \n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,15 January 2019 – Alstom has been awarded three contracts[1] by the Spanish national operator Renfe to provide maintenance services for 15 Avelia Pendolino high-speed trains and 106 suburban trains from Renfe’s current fleet. The contracts, worth a total of €125 million, include preventive, predictive and corrective maintenance for the suburban trains and full maintenance services for the Pendolinos (S-104). All the works will be carried out by Irvia, an Alstom-Renfe joint venture[2].\nAs part of this award, Alstom renews for the next four years (with one extra year as an option) the current maintenance contracts for Renfe’s commuter trains. The preventive and corrective maintenance of these trains will be managed, as it is currently, in Renfe’s depots in Vilanova, Moncada and Mataró, all of which are in the Barcelona area.\nConcerning the contract for Pendolino maintenance, services for the high-speed trains will take place at Cerro Negro (Madrid) and La Sagra (Toledo). Renfe’s Pendolinos were manufactured by Alstom in Santa Perpetua between 2002 and 2005.

The event took place in the presence of His Excellency Macky Sall, the President of Senegal, and Raphael Bernadelli, Managing Director for Central and North Africa at Alstom.\nIn 2016, after an international tender process, APIX awarded Alstom a contract for the supply of 15 regional trains. The first Coradia train for Senegal was successfully received by the customer last September at the Alstom site in Reichshoffen, France, where it is manufactured. Since then, three trains have already arrived in Dakar. The trains will run on the new line linking the centre of Dakar to Blaise Diagne International Airport (AIBD) in Diass. They will serve 14 stations over a distance of 55 km, covered in 45 minutes. The number of passengers is estimated at 115,000 per day.\n\"We are honoured to participate today in the inauguration of this first Coradia Polyvalent train for Senegal. Thanks to the confidence of our customer APIX and the contribution of all Alstom employees, we are proud to place Dakar among the first cities in Africa to acquire such transport technology and thus provide passengers in this country with a safe, reliable and environmentally friendly mobility solution,\" says Raphaël Bernardelli.\nThe Coradia Polyvalent train for Senegal is dual-mode electric and diesel and can travel at speeds of 160 km/h. The train is 72 metres long in total and consists of four cars, providing the capacity for 400 passengers, and includes a first and second class. The passenger is of primary concern for the Coradia Polyvalent trains for Senegal, designed to meet Dakar’s growing mobility needs. Suited to the climatic and environmental conditions of the country, they are equipped with a highly efficient air conditioning system, and their low floor facilitates access and movement on board, in particular for passengers with reduced mobility.\nCoradia Polyvalent belongs to Alstom’s Coradia range of modular trains, which has sold more than 2,800 trains to date with nearly 2,300 currently in circulation, and benefits from over 30 years of expertise and proven technical solutions.',NULL,NULL,1),(1419,'Alstom','Alstom commissions the 500th Vectron locomotive equipped with ETCS Level 2','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2019/1/alstom-commissions-500th-vectron-locomotive-equipped-etcs-level-2','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/01/14/als056_cs_0570.jpg?itok=YVXKo2iG','14 Jan 2019','2023-09-20 17:46:03','Press contact - Samuel Miller\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Samuel Miller \n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contacts - Germany\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Andreas Flórez\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Jörn Bischoff\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Press contact - Belgium - Luxemburg- Netherlands\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Sonia Thibaut \n      \n              Send an email,14 January 2019 - Alstom successfully equipped and commissioned the 500th Vectron locomotive from train manufacturer Siemens Mobility with ATLAS 200, its ETCS[1] level 2 solution at the end of last year. The project is in progress since 2008. It entails the design, supply, homologation, testing and commissioning of the onboard equipment.

The train, codenamed ‘Breeze’, will be a conversion of existing Class 321 trains, reengineering some of the UK’s most reliable rolling stock, to create a clean train for the modern age. These trains could run across the UK as early as 2022, emitting only water and no harmful emissions at all.  \nThe rolling stock conversion will be carried out by Alstom, working in partnership with Eversholt Rail and building upon an established business relationship spanning over 15 years and across multiple rolling stock fleets. This proven and reliable Class 321 is an excellent fit in terms of characteristics, fleet size and availability for conversion to a Hydrogen Multiple Unit (HMU). \nAlstom and Eversholt Rail are working closely with industry stakeholders to develop the business cases and evaluate detailed introduction plans for fleets of these innovative trains and the associated fuelling infrastructure. Alstom and Eversholt Rail also confirmed that their initial, comprehensive engineering study is now complete, and the train design concept finalised. The innovative technical solution defined is the first to allow a hydrogen train to fit within the standard UK loading gauge, and it will also create more space for passengers than the trains they are intended to replace.\nThe Alstom facility in Widnes will manage the conversion of the Breeze trains, creating high quality engineering jobs in this new, emerging sector.  \nThe news follows the introduction in September of Alstom’s Coradia iLint hydrogen trains in Germany, where they now operate in regular passenger service on a daily basis. There is growing interest in Alstom’s hydrogen technology worldwide, including in France where the President of the Occitanie region, Carole Delga, recently announced a proposal to introduce the technology on trains there. \n“Hydrogen train technology is an exciting innovation which has the potential to transform our railway, making journeys cleaner and greener by cutting CO2 emissions even further. We are working with industry to establish how hydrogen trains can play an important part in the future, delivering better services on rural and inter-urban routes,” said Andrew Jones MP, UK Rail Minister.\n“Transport in the UK has evolved over centuries from the world’s first steam train to the tens of thousands of electric vehicles on our roads today thanks to our nation of innovators. This new hydrogen powered train, which will only emit water, is further proof of the UK’s continued creativity to transform the way we travel as we continue to move to a greener, cleaner economy. The UK is on track when it comes to growing a world-leading hydrogen economy, and through our modern Industrial Strategy we are providing £23 million to power our ambition to be the ‘go-to’ place for first-class hydrogen transport,” said Claire Perry MP, UK Minister for Energy and Clean Growth.\n “The Breeze will be a clean new train for the UK with a stylish, modern look. The railways need to decarbonise and the Government has rightly set out a goal to eliminate diesel rolling stock by 2040. Hydrogen trains offer an ideal solution for routes which are unlikely to benefit from electrification, and our innovative engineering solution means they can now fit within the UK loading gauge and can quickly be ready to roll on Britain’s railways. In Germany, Alstom’s hydrogen trains are already transporting passengers in the comfort and quiet that is characteristic of these trains. The Breeze offers British rail users the opportunity to share in the pleasure that is a journey on a hydrogen train,” added Nick Crossfield, Alstom UK & Ireland Managing Director. \n“Eversholt Rail has an enviable record of innovation across its rolling stock portfolio.  Combining the experience gained from the successful Coradia iLint and Class 321 Renatus programmes will deliver a hydrogen-powered multiple unit product that will meet sponsors’ and train operators’ aspirations for the earliest possible fleet introduction,” added Eversholt Rail Client Relations Director Stephen Timothy.',NULL,NULL,1),(1422,'Alstom','Alstom-POSE Consortium to renew signalling system on the General Roca Railway in Buenos Aires, Argentina','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/12/alstom-pose-consortium-renew-signalling-system-general-roca-railway','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2019/01/03/image1.jpeg?itok=laylDXlE','21 Dec 2018','2023-09-20 17:46:21','21 December 2018 - The Alstom-led consortium[1] with POSE signed a contract with a total value of around €90 million[2] to modernise the current signalling system on the General Roca Railway.

SRS technology power-charges the tram—automatically and safely—when it is stationery at stops, as passengers enter and exit it (in under 20 seconds). Electricity gets stored in this way, in the on-board Citadis Ecopack systems, ensuring the tram’s autonomy from one charging point to the next. The SRS solution is based on the operational and safety-oriented principles of the tried-and-tested APS system of ground-level power supply (used in the light-rail networks of Bordeaux, Reims and Dubai).\n‘After the Cadam-Magnan portion became operational, the inauguration of the airport section is a major new step. The T2 tram in Nice is a great source of pride for Alstom and a showcase for the world to see the French rail industry’s expertise. Many innovations designed by our experts have been used in this project: new-generation trams, the new SRS recharging system developed in Vitrolles, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region, and the first internet-connected tram as of spring 2019, with a tram-ground WiFi connection,’ declared Jean-Baptiste Eyméoud, Chairman of Alstom France.\n‘I chose an innovative, high-performance tram system to provide the highest level of comfort for people living in Nice and the surrounding urban area, and for all passengers who use this new line. Today, the west-east line runs to the airport so passengers can enjoy quick access to both terminal 1 and 2 as we have designed a tram station in direct contact with the airport and flush with the ground. Throughout the airport, we find public spaces that are as outstanding as they are along the rest of the line. I have also ensured that the price of an airport ticket is the same as for the entire Lignes d’Azur public-transport network. The west-east tram line will therefore take passengers straight to the airport from the city centre in just a few minutes for 1 euro. That is unique in the world!’ said Christian Estrosi, Mayor of Nice, President of the Nice Côte d’Azur urban area and Vice-President of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region.\nNine of the twelve Alstom sites in France helped design and produce the Line 2 tram system in the Nice Côte d’Azur urban area: La Rochelle (research and tram assembly), Le Creusot (bogies), Ornans (engines), Valenciennes (interior fittings), Villeurbanne (on-board electronics, information for passengers and tram-ground WiFi connection), Aix-en-Provence (tachometer unit), Tarbes (drive-train equipment), Vitrolles (SRS power-charging system) and Saint-Ouen (design coordination, electrical substations).\nIn total, over 2,600 Citadis trams have been sold to over fifty towns in twenty countries.',NULL,NULL,1),(1431,'Alstom','Alstom presents the first tram of the Agglomeration Community of Grand Avignon','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/12/alstom-presents-first-tram-agglomeration-community-grand-avignon','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/12/13/yre_1918.jpg?itok=XoMnCkfg','13 Dec 2018','2023-09-20 17:47:01','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,13 December 2018 – Alstom delivered the first Citadis X05 tram for Grand Avignon on Thursday 13 December after a three-day journey from La Rochelle, where the design and development of the trams is carried out.

The trains are able to operate on 25KV AC (High Speed Line) and 1.5 KV DC (main railway network). Alstom’s Coradia Stream is designed and developed in Saint-Ouen (France) and Salzgitter (Germany) and manufactured in Katowice (Poland). \n“NS congratulates Alstom and the people working in the Alstom Katowice site with the opening of their new fitting hall, ready to produce not only the Coradia Stream trains for NS, but for many more future projects. After the mock-up presentation in 2017 Dutch railway customers can today see that their new Intercity is coming to life in this  state-of-art production facility,” said Roel Okhuijsen. \nAlstom’s Katowice site is a 250,000-square-metre engineering and manufacturing site for metros and regional trains. It is also a worldwide competency centre for metros, and part of Alstom’s Global Engineering Network. Currently, the site employs over 2,000 highly skilled employees. Today, the site runs 19 projects for 10 countries around Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia, and manufactures and exports high-tech products. 100% of its production is destined for the export market. Alstom cooperates with up to 468 Polish suppliers not only for its factories in Poland but also for projects being developed in 27 Alstom sites worldwide.',NULL,NULL,1),(1440,'Alstom','Alstom at the heart of the Tangier-Casablanca  high-speed line’s inauguration in Morocco','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/11/alstom-heart-tangier-casablanca-high-speed-lines-inauguration-morocco','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/11/15/_d6a3646.jpg?itok=om_RRrdy','15 Nov 2018','2023-09-20 17:47:45','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email,15 November 2018 – Alstom participates today in the inauguration of the Tangier-Casablanca high speed line with its very high-speed trains supplied and delivered to the Office National des Chemins de Fer Marocain (ONCF). The line has been inaugurated by His Majesty, King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron. \nAlstom supplied ONCF with 12 very high-speed trains for the Tangier-Casablanca railway section. Alstom also supplied the level 1&2 on-board ERTMS[1] for the trains.  \n“We are extremely proud to bring high speed rail for the first time to the African continent. This inauguration is a significant milestone for this prestigious project which will allow Moroccan people to benefit from an incredible passenger experience thanks to our reliable, safe and comfortable Avelia very high-speed trains. Alstom is committed to remaining a close and long-term partner for Morocco, addressing its mobility needs and supporting its upcoming transport projects,” declared Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom Chairman and CEO.\nThe trains will run at 320 km/h between Tangier and Kenitra, the first 180-km long section of the network. Between Kenitra and Casablanca (200 km), the trains will join the conventional network where they will run at 160 km/h. The service will connect these main economic regions of the country, in 2 hours and 10 minutes instead of 4hours and 45 minutes.\nAvelia Euroduplex trainsets for Morocco are articulated double-deck trains adapted to specific climate and environment conditions. With a capacity of 533 passengers, each trainset is composed of 8 cars including two first-class cars, a dining car and five second class cars. Trains integrate the latest developments in terms of comfort and accessibility. One part of the train is fully dedicated for people with reduced mobility. Trains are also equipped with digital passenger information systems, bilingual in Arabic and French. They benefit from the proven Avelia range of high speed trains, which boasts more than 1,100 trains in commercial service.\nAvelia Euroduplex very high speed trains for this project were manufactured in Alstom sites in France: La Rochelle, Belfort, Ornans, Tarbes, Le Creusot, Petit Quevilly, Villeurbanne, Saint-Ouen, Reichshoffen. \nAlstom, present in Morocco for over 40 years, supports the country in its most important mobility projects, from urban to main lines, and has always been at the service of its customers and partners in the development of the country’s rail infrastructure.\n[1] European Rail Traffic Management System',NULL,NULL,1),(1441,'Alstom','Excellent results for Alstom in the first half 2018/19','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/11/excellent-results-alstom-first-half-201819','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/10/02/hq_alstom.jpg?itok=JZoOcjwC','14 Nov 2018','2023-09-20 17:47:49','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,Strong commercial momentum with €7 billion orders, leading to a new record-breaking backlog of €38 billion\nOutstanding operational performance with sales at €4 billion and adjusted EBIT margin of 7%\nPositive free cash flow and solid balance sheet\n \n14 November 2018 – Between 1 April 2018 and 30 September 2018, Alstom booked €7.1 billion of orders leading to a new record-breaking backlog of €38.1 billion.

The new record-breaking backlog provides strong visibility on future sales and our outstanding operational performance reflects the solid projects execution. In the meantime, we continue to progress on the combination with Siemens Mobility to create substantial value for the mobility sector, our customers, every day users of our transport solutions as well as for our employees and our shareholders.” said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n***\nSuccess of the 2020 strategy \nAlstom 2020 strategy is based on the five following pillars:\nCustomer-focused organisation\nThe Group booked €7,129 million orders in the first half of fiscal year 2018/19. This compares to €3,170 million over the same period last year. \nAlstom was awarded projects in all regions, including an order for 100 next-generation very high speed trains in France, a driverless light metro system for Montreal, Pendolino trains and maintenance in Italy, a major rolling stock contract for Mumbai, an integrated metro system for Taipei, additional Citadis Dualis tram-trains in France, a long-term rolling stock and signalling maintenance contract for Sydney metro, a national on-board train control system in Norway, electric locomotives in Morocco and Citadis trams for Frankfurt. \nThe backlog reached a new record high and amounted to €38,113 million on 30 September 2018, providing strong visibility on future sales.\nComplete range of solutions\nIn the first half of fiscal year 2018/19, Alstom’s total sales reached €4,010 million, up 20% (23% organically). The book-to-bill was strong at 1.8.\nSignalling, systems and services represented 57% of sales in the first half of 2018/19. Systems sales reached €888 million with a strong ramp-up on Dubai metro and Lusail tram systems projects and progress on Riyadh metro system. Services sales increased to €749 million notably thanks to the increasing contribution of United Kingdom and Italy contracts. Signalling sales increased at €637 million with the start of new projects in France and in Australia. Rolling stock sales reached €1,736 million with deliveries of regional and high-speed trains in Europe and the on-going execution of the PRASA project in South Africa. \nValue creation through innovation\nAlstom sustained its level of research and development (gross costs) at €147 million, i.e. 3.7% of sales, in first half of 2018/19. Main programmes included the renewal of rolling stock ranges, smart mobility and predictive maintenance. \nIn September 2018, Alstom’s hydrogen trains Coradia iLint entered passenger service in Lower Saxony, a world premiere. Alstom also launched StationOne, the first online marketplace dedicated to the railway sector.\nOperational and environmental excellence\nAlstom delivered an adjusted EBIT of €285 million corresponding to 7.1% margin in first half 2018/19, compared to €180 million corresponding 5.4% margin the previous year. This improvement was driven by a significant volume increase and on-going initiatives for operational excellence, while portfolio mix remained stable. Net Income (Group share) reached to €563 million, including an exceptional net income from discontinued operations of €245 million.\nIn September 2018, Alstom has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), World and Europe for the eighth consecutive year, attesting to its leading position in sustainable business practices. \nDiverse and entrepreneurial people\nTo reflect Alstom’s passenger base, the company has the ambition to increase diversity. Alstom’s employees around the world all share the same culture, underpinned by strong integrity and ethics values. \nIn September 2018, Alstom distributed 30 free shares to its employees as part of the \"We are Alstom\" employee share ownership scheme, launched in 2016. After a two-year acquisition period, nearly 25,000 employees received these shares or their equivalent in the form of bonuses.\n***\nSolid balance sheet\nDuring the first half of fiscal year 2018/19, the Group free cash flow was positive at €172 million, benefitting from the Cash Focus programme. \nAlstom invested €85 million in capital expenditures in the first half 2018/19. As end of September 2018, the cumulated transformation capex stood at €212 million, out of €300 million, with the progress in sites’ construction in South Africa, in India and the Hornell site extension in the United States. \nThe Group had a gross cash in hand of €1,397 million at the end of September 2018 and a fully undrawn credit line of €400 million. Alstom bond debt amounted to €1,249 million as end of September 2018. In October 2018, Alstom reimbursed at maturity a €371 million bond.\nAlstom net debt amounted to €280 million on 30 September 2018, compared to €255 million on 31 March 2018. Last, equity reached €4,021 million at 30 September 2018, compared to €3,479 million on 31 March 2018.\n***\nInvestments\nAlstom, previously owning 33% of TMH, reinforced its investment in Russia by reaching a 20% stake in the combined entity that TMH created with Locotech, another Russian company operating in the services activity. The deal represented an investment of €115 million and was completed on 29 June 2018. In the first half of 2018/19, TMH contributed €49 million as share of net income in equity investees, compared to €14 million over the same period last year.\nOn 2 October 2018, Alstom has completed the transfer of all its interests in the three Energy Joint Ventures (Renewables, Grid and Nuclear Joint Ventures) to General Electric and received a total cash payment of €2.594 billion. \n***\nOutlook\nThe Alstom outlook is provided at constant perimeter and exchange rate. It is set in accordance with the IFRS 15 standard, which is the new applicable standard for revenue recognition.\nFor the fiscal year 2018/19, sales are expected to reach around €8 billion and adjusted EBIT margin should reach around 7%. \nIn the medium term, Alstom should continue to outperform the market growth, gradually improve profitability, and improve cash generation, with possible volatility over some short periods.\n***\nCreation of a global leader in Mobility\nThe proposed combination of Alstom with Siemens Mobility, including its rail traction drive business, has reached significant milestones in the past months. \nOn 17 July 2018, Alstom shareholders approved the proposed combination of Alstom with Siemens Mobility.\nAs part of the combination, Alstom existing shareholders at the close of the business day preceding the completion date of the transaction, will receive two exceptional distributions: a control premium of €4 per share (Distribution A) and an extraordinary distribution of up to €4 per share subject to certain adjustments (Distribution B). Payment of both distributions shall be made on the 8th business day following the date of closing of this transaction.\nAlstom should implement a share repurchase program in the coming period, with cancellation of the number of Alstom shares necessary to ensure a shareholding of the Siemens Group representing 50.67% of Alstom’s issued share capital as of the determination date[1] and of at least 50% on a fully diluted basis as of the completion date of the transaction. The amount of the repurchase global price is one of the adjustments that may impact the amount of the Distribution B. \nOn 8 June, Alstom and Siemens jointly filed the application for merger control clearance with the European Commission and on 13 July, Alstom and Siemens took note of the European Commission’s initiation of a Phase 2 review of the proposed combination of Siemens’ Mobility business with Alstom. \nOn 29 October, Alstom and Siemens received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission as part of the Phase 2 examination of the proposed combination. The Statement of Objections formalises the Commission’s assessment of this transaction at this stage and gives Alstom and Siemens the opportunity to access the case file and respond to the Commission. It does not prejudge of the final decision of the European Commission. \nAlstom and Siemens continue to work constructively with the European Commission to explain the rationale and the benefits of the proposed combination. Alstom and Siemens will now discuss the specific concerns of the Commission and will ensure that they are addressed in a timely manner.\nThe transaction is subject to approval by relevant anti-trust authorities and closing is expected in the first half of 2019.\n*The management report and the consolidated financial statements, as approved by the Board of Directors, in its meeting held on 13 November 2018, are available on Alstom’s website at www.alstom.com. The accounts have been reviewed by the auditors. \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements which are based on current plans and forecasts of Alstom’s management.

Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.\nOrder backlog\nOrder backlog represents sales not yet recognised on orders already received. \nOrder backlog at the end of a financial year is computed as follows:\norder backlog at the beginning of the year;\nplus new orders received during the year;\nless cancellations of orders recorded during the year;\nless sales recognised during the year.\nThe order backlog is also subject to changes in the scope of consolidation, contract price adjustments and foreign currency translation effects.\nBook-to-Bill \nThe book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period. \nAdjusted EBIT\nWhen Alstom’s new organisation was implemented, adjusted EBIT (“aEBIT”) became the key performance indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.\naEBIT corresponds to earning before interests, tax and net result from equity method investments adjusted with the following elements: \nnet restructuring expenses (including rationalisation costs); \ntangibles and intangibles impairment;\ncapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entity;\nand any other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realise business combinations and amortisation of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of business. \nA non-recurring item is a “one-off” exceptional item that is not supposed to be reappearing in following years and that is significant.\nAdjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT in percentage of sales.\nThe non-GAAP measure adjusted EBIT indicator reconciles with the GAAP measure EBIT as follows:\n\n \n\n\nHalf-year ended\n\n\nHalf-year ended\n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\n30 Sept. 2017\n(rest.

In particular, free cash ﬂow does not include the proceeds from disposals of activity.\nThe most directly comparable financial measure to free cash flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities. \nA reconciliation of free cash ﬂow and net cash provided by operating activities is presented below:\n \n\n \n\n\nHalf-year ended\n\n\nHalf-year ended\n\n\nHalf-year ended\n\n\n(in € million)\n\n\n30 Sept. 2017\n(published)\n\n\n30 Sept. 2017\n(rest.

The train, produced at Alstom’s site in Katowice in Poland, arrived in Dubai after being shipped from Bremerhaven Port in Germany. Alstom will conduct initial static and dynamic tests in the depot over the next few months. \nIn 2016, the Alstom-led ExpoLink consortium, also composed of ACCIONA and Gulermak, has signed a contract with RTA to design and build the extension of Dubai’s Red metro line and upgrade the existing line. The project, also known as Route 2020, is worth a total of €2.6 billion, and is expected to start commercial service in 2020, in time for the World Expo.\n“We are extremely proud to hand over, on time, the first Metropolis trainset to RTA. This is a significant milestone in a prestigious project that will provide Dubai residents and visitors to with a reliable, comfortable and environmentally-friendly metro system ahead of the World Expo. Alstom is committed to being a close, long-term partner of the UAE, addressing its mobility needs and supporting it in its upcoming transport projects,” declared Didier Pfleger, Alstom Senior Vice President for Middle East & Africa.\nAlstom’s scope covers the provision of the entire metro system, including 50 Metropolis trainsets, power supply, driverless signalling, communication and security, automatic fare control, track works, platform screen doors and a three-year warranty on the whole system. Additionally, Alstom will enhance the existing metro line by upgrading power supply, signalling systems, communication and track works. \nThe Metropolis trainsets for Dubai are 85,5 meters long and composed of five cars each. They will be able to carry up to 700 passengers[2] each. The train offers an excellent level of passenger experience, thanks to wide gangways, large doors and windows, three specific areas for Silver, Family and Gold Classes.

In 2003, Virgin Trains introduced the Alstom built trains and they have reduced journey times on the line and transformed connectivity. Along the 1,265-kilometre route, the last year (2017/18) saw 38.3 million passenger journeys made totalling 7,582.3 million passenger kilometres.[1] \nThe fleet is receiving a complete re-paint to protect them and ensure they have a successful future on the route. Each train takes two weeks to complete. The work involves stripping back the cars, including exterior fittings, undertaking minor repairs and restoration and comprehensively re-painting, a layer at a time, to prevent corrosion and rust. This protects against wear and tear and will enable the trains to operate as successfully for the second half of their life, as they have done for the first. With advances in paint technology the newly painted trains are finished as well, or better, than when they were first introduced.\nThe repaint is being completed in Alstom’s Widnes modernisation facility, the most advanced in the country. It was built to be able to accommodate the full length of the 9 and 11 car trains end-to-end and is the only facility in the UK that can do this. The main modernisation hall in Widnes is so large that it rivals the size of the deck of the UK’s flagship new Queen Elizabeth II aircraft carrier. \nPiers Wood, Managing Director Fleet Services, Alstom UK & Ireland, said: \n“We are very proud of the job we’re doing with this repaint. These iconic Pendolinos are the backbone of Britain’s railways, and this will allow them to continue serving the millions of passengers they carry every year. A repaint of this scale has never been undertaken by the industry before and it is particularly special for us as it is the first piece of major work we are doing at our state-of-the-art Widnes facility. \n“We are also pleased that this programme has allowed us to bring on some brilliant apprentices, who are now a key part of our team at Widnes. With our partners at Virgin Trains and Angel Trains we want this programme and this iconic train to continue to be a real showcase of what we can achieve in the industry.”\nPeter Broadley, Executive Director for Customer, Operations and Safety at Virgin Trains, said: \n“The new look Pendolino is certainly catching the eye and its of great credit to all involved that will we have a fully repainted fleet by December 2019.” \nDavid Jordan, Chief Operating Officer, Angel Trains, said: \n“We are delighted with the progress of the Pendolino repainting project. We know that this transformative work, led by our partners at Alstom, will both improve the longevity of this Class 390 fleet and benefit British rail passengers for years to come.”\nAlstom’s Widnes facility is located right at the heart of the Manchester and Liverpool rail cluster. It includes Alstom’s training academy, delivered in partnership with the National College for High Speed Rail. Eight local apprentices have been taken on as part of the 85 strong workforce for the paint programme and Alstom are also working with the National College of High Speed Rail to offer higher level qualifications to former apprentices and increase skill levels amongst the local workforce.\nWidnes is also the home for the technical and engineering talent in Alstom’s Centre of Excellence for Modernisation. It is set to become Alstom’s hydrogen train centre in the UK and it will be the site where Class 321 trains are converted to hydrogen traction under Alstom’s plans with Eversholt rail. \n[1] ORR, https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/displayreport/html/html/c7cf70e5-0514-44be-8ecd-0f1c89074cef',NULL,NULL,1),(1445,'Alstom','Alstom launches the production of on-board transformers in Kazakhstan','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/10/alstom-launches-production-board-transformers-kazakhstan','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/10/31/alstom_ekz_03.jpg?itok=d29MLZKe','31 Oct 2018','2023-09-20 17:48:12','Press contact - Western and Central Asia\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Zaure Shubayeva\n      \n              Send an email,31 October 2018 – Alstom launched the production of on-board transformers for the electric locomotives in the EKZ joint venture in Astana, Kazakhstan.

Smart City Expo World Congress (SCEWC), the leading international event for cities, will host on 2018 its eighth edition. Under the theme Cities To Live In, it will gather over 700 cities, 700 exhibitors and 400 speakers that will address, among others, the challenges to boost the transaction to a smarter and  more sustainable mobility. \nAs a provider of Mobility solutions in the digitalization era, Alstom will showcase its latest developments in this field. Technologies such as augmented reality, 5G connectivity, Big Data, IoT, video analytics, or virtual reality are redefining the present and the future of mobility in our cities. \nIn this regard, Alstom Digital Mobility (ADM) including the Smart Mobility Lab in Spain have developed technologies to respond to both the requirements of passengers (passenger experience) and of operators (sustainability, fluidity, multi-modality, availability and efficiency). \nFor passengers, Alstom presents its Optimet OrbanMap solution, a real-time dynamic information system provided to passengers in metro stations.  Optimet OrbanMap allows visualisation at a glance of the metro network, its activity, trains position, travel times, service interruptions, and the level of comfort aboard the trains.\nFor operators and Transport Authorities, Alstom has developed Mastria, the first multimodal supervision solution. Thanks to Mastria, all the actors of mobility in a given city are linked: bus, tram and metro networks but also taxi, shared cars and bikes, police, etc. The objective is to maximise fluidity between all the means of transportation in a city and to orchestrate passenger routes. Thanks to the application of advance data analytics, it can also predict and anticipate possible incidents, in order to improve mobility management within the city. \nTogether with intermodality, current great challenge for transport authorities is safety. Alstom has therefore developed Iconis Security, an integrated solution to manage security operations, passenger information and communications within the control centre, providing efficient, responsive and seamless supervision of both the onboard and wayside installations.  Iconis Security is  capable of detecting and managing all types of incidents that may  affect the safety for passengers, staff and infrastructures, such as abandoned objects, intrusions on the track, overcrowding on platforms and even video-tracking in real time, among others. With the aim to ease real-time and remote management, Alstom has developed a virtual control room that uses HoloLens[i] augmented reality. \nAlstom Booth: Pavillon 2 – Booth D509\nCongress Schedule (Alstom participation) \nTitle: Solving the riddle of mobility for today and tomorrow (Mastria)\nPanel: Public Transport Networks - Customizing the way we move\nSpeaker: Alvaro Urech\nDate: Wednesday, 14th November, General slot 15:15H-17:15H\nVenue: Hall 2, World Congress Area\n	 \n[i] HoloLens is a Microsoft Corporation trademark.',NULL,NULL,1),(1447,'Alstom','Alstom’s Gibela joint-venture opens Africa’s largest train manufacturing facility in Dunnottar, South Africa','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/10/alstoms-gibela-joint-venture-opens-africas-largest-train-manufacturing','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/10/25/aerial008_002.jpg?itok=E74siW6l','25 Oct 2018','2023-09-20 17:48:21','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,25 October 2018 - The Alstom-led Gibela joint-venture has today inaugurated the largest and most advanced centre for train manufacturing in Africa – the first of its kind on the continent.

The firm part of this contract awarded to Alstom covers the delivery of 150 cars (25 trains of 6 cars each) for a total amount of over 280 million Euros[1].\nThese new, high-capacity, steel-wheeled metros will be able to circulate at speeds of up to 110 km/h in automatic driverless mode, taking the form of six-car trains on line 15 and three-car trains on lines 16 and 17.\nThe first trains will leave the factory from 2022 onwards and initial entry into commercial service is scheduled for 2024. \nÎle-de-France Mobilités will be making these trains available to future operators, thus giving them access to new-generation material that benefits from the latest technologies and offers a high level of performance. The travel experience will combine comfort and speed.\nValérie Pécresse, President of the Île-de-France Region and of Île de France Mobilités, says: \"With air conditioning, video protection, USB plugs and efficient tools for providing onboard information, the new trains for Île-de-France Mobilités will provide users of Île de France’s new metro lines with high levels of comfort and safety, something I insist on for all orders of new material, metros as well as trains, RERs, buses and trams. These metros will also symbolise the modernity and dynamism of Europe’s leading economic region.”\n“The acquisition of the trains destined to run on the lines of the Grand Paris Express represents the accomplishment of one more step in implementing the new metro. It follows the award of a series of important civil engineering contracts and paves the way for the first contracts for the systems that will equip these infrastructures. This is good news for companies who are seeing their order books fill up, as well as for the residents of Île de France, for whom the Grand Paris Express is taking more shape every day.”\nThierry Dallard, President of the Board of Directors of Société du Grand Paris\n”We are very proud of the renewed confidence of Île-de-France Mobilités and the decision of Société du Grand Paris to award this new contract to us. We are also particularly pleased to contribute, through this new project, to the government\'s determination to double the Paris metro network over the next 15 years,” says Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman & CEO of Alstom. \nA new experience in public transport travel\nThe new metros for lines 15, 16 and 17 are open throughout the entire length of the train, providing passengers with a sociable, roomy, comfortable space. Thanks to the 3 large doors on each side, they increase fluidity in the exits and entrances, as well as facilitating passenger movement during travel. The equipment has been designed for high levels of comfort, notably thanks to the air conditioning, lighting and seats. It will also offer connectivity to passengers with USB charging points for mobile phones. Finally, the end of the train is structured to provide a panoramic opening with a wide windscreen.\nBased on the solutions of Alstom’s Metropolis range and further improved by feedback from its customers, the new metros for lines 15, 16 and 17 will guarantee the highest levels of availability, reliability and security. Each train will be able to transport up to 500 passengers in its three-car version (54 metres), and up to 1,000 passengers in its six-car version (108 metres). Particular attention has been given to optimising maintenance. The onboard diagnostic system will provide information on the condition of the train equipment and give maintenance personnel an overview of the fleet’s condition, making it easier to plan corrective maintenance tasks between commercial services. Alstom has also extended the maintenance sequence of the new metros, permitting significant cost reductions throughout the lifecycle of the trains.\nNumerous innovations guarantee the new material’s environmental performance, which is an undeniable asset for operation. Traction and auxiliary converters will benefit from the very latest technology developed by Alstom, guaranteeing optimised energy consumption. Special attention has been paid to noise emissions, vibrations and atmospheric emissions. Brake particle emissions will be minimised by electric braking right up to a very low speed, limiting brake disc use. Furthermore, the recovery of braking energy will play a role in charging the batteries or supplying power to the general electricity network. Last but not least, the train has a recyclability rate of more than 96% and, in line with current European standards, a recovery rate of over 98%.\nIn total, 350 Alstom employees in France, including 150 experienced engineers, will be working on this vitally important project to ensure its successful implementation. More than 1150 jobs will be secured in France for the French rail sector as a result of the project. Alstom, a solidarity-based enterprise, will also reserve significant volumes of work on its French sites in terms of manpower hours planned for this contract for people experiencing particular social or professional difficulties.\nThe trains will be designed and manufactured by six of Alstom’s sites in France. The site of Valenciennes Petite-Forêt will be in charge of project management, studies, development, production, assembly and validation. Five other Alstom sites in France will develop and produce the components: Le Creusot for the bogies, Ornans for the engines, Tarbes for the traction systems, Villeurbanne for the on-board electronics and the remote maintenance system and Saint Ouen for the design.\n[1] This contract will be booked at the latest in Q3 of the current fiscal year.',NULL,NULL,1),(1457,'Alstom','Alstom signs Memorandum of Understanding with Ukrainian Railways for electric locomotives','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/9/alstom-signs-memorandum-understanding-ukrainian-railways-electric','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/09/19/MOU%20UKRAINE%20-%20Copyright%20Alstom%20TOMA%20V%20Baillais.jpg?itok=TC-uNvxt','19 Sep 2018','2023-09-20 17:49:12','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,19 September 2018 – Alstom and Ukrainian Railways (UZ) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding officialising cooperation for the provision and maintenance of electric locomotives.

It also encompasses the homologation of the product in Ukraine and the provision of all relevant documentation by Alstom. \n“I am very pleased to be officialising this cooperation with Ukrainian Railways today. Alstom is present in over 60 countries and we are proud to count Ukraine among them. Wherever we are, we adapt to local conditions and propose suitable solutions to our customers. We see the high potential of the Ukrainian market, and we would be proud to contribute to the modernisation of the country’s railway infrastructure and its further integration within the broader European railway market,” said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and CEO of Alstom. \n\"Alstom is one of the world\'s leading rail transport manufacturers. I am pleased with the fact that today\'s memorandum is a starting point for our cooperation with the French company. Our strategic goal is to renew our fleet of locomotives. As we already have a strategic partner in the supply of diesel locomotives, we are actively exploring the possibilities for the effective cooperation on the renewal of the electric locomotive fleet. Almost 47% of Ukraine’s railways have been electrified, but the goal is to increase the number of electrified areas up to 54% within two years. Cooperation with Alstom is also very important for us because the company has considerable experience in the manufacture of 1520mm gauge electric locomotives. Moreover, the possibility of maximum localization at Ukrainian enterprises is the essential condition in the cooperation with Alstom”, said Yevgen Kravtsov, Acting CEO of Ukrainian Railways.\nFollowing preliminary meetings held in April this year between Alstom’s management and Ukrainian authorities, Alstom has opened a representative office in the country. \nThe Ukrainian railway network is 1520mm gauge with over 22,000 kilometres of track. The country plans to develop international railway routes to Europe and to modernise its transport infrastructure in all segments, from urban with trams and metros, to mainline with regional and intercity trains or high-speed lines. \nAlstom can already boast significant experience in 1520mm gauge railways, specifically in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, where it has been delivering freight and passengers locomotives adapted to the local requirements since 2010. These include heavy freight Prima T8 locomotives, which feature very high hauling capacity. They ensure the highest tractive efforts on electrified networks, with appropriate comfort and maximum safety for covering long distances. The latest Prima T8 versions, such as the KZ8A for Kazakhstan and the AZ8A for Azerbaijan, can haul up to 9,000 tons and can run at 120 km/h.

Today, the four companies agreed to conduct technical feasibility studies regarding the integration of hybrid drives developed by MTU, a Rolls-Royce brand, into Coradia Lint rail vehicles and their use on routes of Dieselnetz Saxony-Anhalt, a diesel-powered rail network in Germany. The four partners plan to sign a contract covering the retrofit of at least three vehicles once the studies have been successfully concluded and financing is secured. To this effect, the companies signed a letter of intent at Innotrans, the world’s leading trade fair for railway and transport technology. Subsequent conversion of the entire fleet of 54 Coradia Lint vehicles is under consideration. The hybrid drives combine a modern diesel engine with an electric motor and batteries to recover braking energy, reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 25 percent. In addition, the ability to run under battery power only can reduce noise pollution in city areas and stations by 75 percent (20 dB(A)). \nStephan Schreier, Managing Director, Operations at Abellio, said: “As one of the largest operators of local rail passenger transport services in Saxony-Anhalt, we are aware of the special role we play in climate protection and, with this project, are pressing ahead unswervingly in the transition to lower-emission solutions.” \nDr Jörg Nikutta, Managing Director Germany and Austria at Alstom, said: “Alternative drive systems have become an important aspect of rail transportation. Alstom has been leading the way in this for many years now to reduce emissions. It is important for us, working with our partners, to add a new feature to our well-proven diesel train Coradia Lint and offer a hybrid traction solution that is quickly available and delivers immediate benefits for travellers and the environment.”\nRüdiger Malter, Managing Director at NASA, said: “The state of Saxony-Anhalt is very active on behalf of alternative drive solutions and low-emission transport. The planned hybrid trains are an important contribution to environmentally friendly rail travel which can be realized within a short time.” \nLars Kräft, Vice President Industrial Business at Rolls-Royce Power Systems, said: “Our MTU Hybrid PowerPack is a pioneering high-tech drive system combining the benefits of battery and diesel-powered trains without the need for additional infrastructure. We look forward to working with our partners to bring this technology into regular service here in Germany.” \nAbellio is due to commence passenger services on behalf of the state of Saxony-Anhalt in December 2018 on 16 non-electrified lines in Saxony-Anhalt using 54 Coradia Lint trains. The contract covering the conversion of the first three of these vehicles to MTU hybrid drives is planned to be signed by the end of 2018. The conversion program is expected to take less than three years and will start operating in pilot mode to collect findings related to a normal daily use of a hybrid fleet. \nThe Coradia Lint is a fuel-efficient diesel multiple unit (DMU) that can reach operating speeds of up to 140 kph. It is powered by two MTU PowerPacks, each based on the MTU Series 1800 engine that meets the strict requirements of the current EU Stage IIIB emissions directive. The Hybrid PowerPack is an even more environmentally friendly version of this proven drive system: It combines an MTU diesel engine plus an electric machine, which can be used either as an electric motor or generator, and the MTU EnergyPack battery system, which stores the energy recovered during braking. This enables very low-noise, emissions-free battery-only electric operation in urban areas and around stations. The total operating costs of rail vehicles with MTU hybrid drives are also significantly lower. Even brake pads and discs have reduced wear due to brake energy recuperation. Because of the additional power of the electric machine, train operators also have the possibility to make up time delays using the improved drive dynamics and acceleration. \nThe Coradia Lint is part of Alstom’s Coradia range of modular trains which benefit from more than 30 years of service experience and proven technical solutions. Over 2800 Coradia trains have been sold to date, with 2300 of them currently operating in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and Canada.',NULL,NULL,1),(1459,'Alstom','Alstom to supply 5 more Citadis trams to Frankfurt','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/9/alstom-supply-5-more-citadis-trams-frankfurt','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/09/13/2018_06_14_lrv_frankfurt_ext_3-4_views_3_copyright_alstom.jpg?itok=VQq3ylsc','19 Sep 2018','2023-09-20 17:49:20','Press contacts - Germany\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Andreas Flórez\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Jörn Bischoff\n      \n              Send an email,19 September 2018 – Alstom signed today a contract with Stadtwerke Verkehrsgesellschaft Frankfurt am Main mbH (VGF), the transport operator in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, for the supply of 5 additional Citadis trams.

Before the many guests and members of the press from Germany and abroad, the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train rolled into the station. The Coradia iLint, built by Alstom in Salzgitter, Germany, is equipped with fuel cells which convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, thus eliminating pollutant emissions related to propulsion. From 17 September onwards, two such trains will enter commercial service according to a fixed timetable in Lower Saxony.\nFor the time being, it is travellers in EVB’s Elbe-Weser network who can look forward to a world-first journey on the low-noise, zero-emission trains that reach up to 140 km/h. On behalf of LNVG, the Coradia iLint trains will be operated on nearly 100km of line running between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude, replacing EVB’s existing diesel fleet. The new trains will be fuelled at a mobile hydrogen filling station. The gaseous hydrogen will be pumped into the trains from a 40-foot-high steel container next to the tracks at Bremervörde station. With one tank, they can run throughout the network the whole day, thanks to a total autonomy of 1000 km. A stationary filling station on EVB premises is scheduled to go into operation in 2021, when Alstom will deliver a further 14 Coradia iLint trains to LNVG.   \n\"This is a revolution for Alstom and for the future of mobility. The world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train is entering passenger service and is ready for serial production,” emphasises Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and CEO of Alstom. “The Coradia iLint heralds a new era in emission-free rail transport. It is an innovation that results from French-German teamwork and exemplifies successful cross-border cooperation.”\nDr. Bernd Althusmann, Lower Saxony’s Minister of Economy and Transport, whose department has supported LNVG’s purchase of another 14 hydrogen trains with more than €81 million, is impressed: “With the test operation starting today, Lower Saxony is performing real pioneering work in local transport in cooperation with Alstom and EVB. The emission-free drive technology of the Coradia iLint provides a climate-friendly alternative to conventional diesel trains, particularly on non-electrified lines,” he explains. “In successfully proving the operability of the fuel cell technology in daily service, we will set the course for rail transport to be largely operated climate-friendly and emission-free in the future. The state government of Lower Saxony is proud of putting this trendsetting project on the track together with LNVG.”\nThe federal government has actively supported the development and testing of the new drive technology in Lower Saxony by providing funds from the National Innovation Programme for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology. \nEnak Ferlemann, Federal Government Commissioner for Rail Transport and Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, puts it in a nutshell: “A world premiere in Germany. We are putting the first passenger train with fuel cell technology on the track. This is a strong sign for the mobility of the future. Hydrogen is a real, low-emission and efficient alternative to diesel. These trains can be operated cleanly and in an environmentally friendly way, especially on secondary lines where overhead lines are uneconomical or not available yet.” He added: “We therefore support and fund this technology, in order to expand it.”   \nFor LNVG chief Carmen Schwabl, whose authority organizes the rail passenger transport between the North Sea and the Harz mountains and therefore pays annual compensation of around €300 million to the railway companies, the entry to fuel cell technology is also a strategic decision. She sees LNVG in a national pioneering role: “With the two Coradia iLint trains and with the use of another 14 hydrogen trains from the end of 2021, we are the first passenger rail transport authority to replace existing diesel vehicles by emission-free vehicles, thus contributing better to the fulfilment of the climate protection goals.” LNVG’s Managing Director looks further into the future: “We also do this because about 120 diesel trainsets in our vehicle pool will reach the end of their lifetime within the next 30 years, meaning we will have to replace them. The experience gained with this project helps us find a sustainable and practical solution.” \nWith around 2 million rail passengers and around 4 million bus passengers per year, EVB figures among the largest mobility providers in the Elbe-Weser triangle. The traditional company, which boasts a history of more than 100 years and around 550 employees, is looking forward to the “train of the future”.  Dr. Marcel Frank, Managing Director of EVB, emphasizes: “It is a great milestone that we will use the world’s first hydrogen-powered train in our Elbe-Weser network in passenger service between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude, not only for the region and for us, but also for passenger rail transport worldwide. For EVB, this is the entry to emission-free mobility.”   \nPictures of the event: reneframpe.com/clients/evb\nFurther Information on Coradia iLint: https://als.ptn.rs/a/158013',NULL,NULL,1),(1465,'Alstom','Alstom included in Dow Jones Sustainability Indices  for eighth consecutive year','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/9/alstom-included-dow-jones-sustainability-indices-eighth-consecutive-year','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/10/_MG_7200A%20%281%29.jpg?itok=zI9DJODi','14 Sep 2018','2023-09-20 17:49:47','Press contacts - Corporate\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Coralie Collet\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Samuel Miller\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n            Investor relations\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Martin Vaujour\n      \n              Send an email\n                \n  \n                \n      \n            Estelle Maturell Andino\n      \n              Send an email,14 September 2018 – Alstom has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), World and Europe for the eighth consecutive year, attesting to its leading position in sustainable business practices.

The vehicles will be equipped with NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide) Li-ion battery technology as a standard feature.\nForsee Power has been chosen for its advanced technology in terms of yield and density, its competitiveness and its ability to provide a recyclable product, from collection to the re-use of cells. Alstom is thus betting on a reliable solution and close partnership with a flagship of French technology.\nAlstom and Forsee Power have worked together to define the most suitable product for Aptis, while retaining the vehicle’s openness to different battery technologies and charging speeds. The vehicle’s design, with most of its equipment on the roof, coupled with the modularity of the ZEN35 battery packs, give Aptis the greatest range flexibility when compared to other vehicles in its category. Alstom has developed precise simulation tools to establish the onboard energy required by operators and thus design the vehicle most suited to the requirements of each line (with range per charge from 150km to over 250km).\nAlstom and Forsee Power are also collaborating on the best way to monitor battery use in real time, thereby optimising usage cycles and thus battery life expectancy.\nFinally, Alstom has developed long-term battery leasing solutions that allow municipalities to reduce the financial impact of purchasing electric buses by spreading the cost of the batteries over the lifespan of the vehicle[1].\nSeven of Alstom’s sites in France are involved in the design and manufacture of Aptis: Duppigheim for the overall engineering, bodywork, testing and certification, Saint-Ouen for the system integration, Tarbes for the traction, Ornans for the engines, Villeurbanne for the electronic components of the traction chain and Reichshoffen for the manufacture of the central passenger module, final assembly and in-series tests. Finally, the Alstom site of Vitrolles is responsible for developing one of the charging solutions (SRS).\n[1] A 20-year lifespan, longer than the lifespan of other electric buses, thanks to the structure of the vehicle and its electrical components derived from trams.',NULL,NULL,1),(1485,'Alstom','Alstom shareholders approve all submitted resolutions and the proposed combination of Alstom with Siemens Mobility business','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/7/general-meeting-17072018','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/10/_MG_7200A%20%281%29.jpg?itok=zI9DJODi','17 Jul 2018','2023-09-20 17:51:30','',NULL,NULL,1),(1486,'Alstom','Coradia iLint hydrogen train receives approval for commercial operation in German railway networks','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/7/coradia-ilint-hydrogen-train-receives-approval-for-commercial-operation-in-german-railway-networks','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/12/coradia_ilint-11-5-2017-06.jpg?itok=SUud4VRe','11 Jul 2018','2023-09-20 17:51:37','',NULL,NULL,1),(1487,'Alstom','Alstom awarded long term rolling stock and signalling maintenance contract for Sydney Metro','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/7/alstom-awarded-long-term-rolling-stock-and-signalling-maintenance-contract-for-sydney-metro-','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/19/Global/OneAlstomPlus/Railsystems/Pressreleases/2018/20180711-SydneyMetro-800x450.png?itok=qHgT1uFw','11 Jul 2018','2023-09-20 17:51:42','',NULL,NULL,1),(1488,'Alstom','Alstom to supply integrated metro system for Taipei Metro Line 7','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/7/alstom-to-supply-integrated-metro-system-for-taipei-metro-line-7','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/23/wanda.jpg?itok=qA5ZJaZW','10 Jul 2018','2023-09-20 17:51:49','',NULL,NULL,1),(1489,'Alstom','Alstom unveils the first tram for Caen la mer in France','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/7/alstom-unveils-the-first-tram-for-caen-la-mer-in-france','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/19/Global/OneAlstomPlus/Railsystems/Pressreleases/2018/20181007---07886---800x320.jpg?itok=C4QwVrOV','10 Jul 2018','2023-09-20 17:51:56','',NULL,NULL,1),(1490,'Alstom','Alstom to showcase sustainable mobility and digitalisation  at InnoTrans 2018','https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2018/7/alstom-to-showcase-sustainable-mobility-and-digitalisation-at-innotrans-2018','https://www.alstom.com/sites/alstom.com/files/styles/related_article_cover/public/2018/07/22/womanwithtraininnotrans148468.jpg?itok=oPOD9wYD','09 Jul 2018','2023-09-20 17:52:03','Press Contacts\n      \n    \n                  \n      \n            Visit our media section and follow the link \"Press contacts\",20180709-InnoTrans2018-800x450.png\nAt InnoTrans 2018, the worlds largest trade fair for the railway industry, Alstom will be showcasing innovations that help drive the global transition to more sustainable transportation and which exemplify the digitalisation of the mobility sector. \nAs a major player of the environmental revolution, Alstom will present its growing range of innovative solutions in rolling stock, including the worlds first hydrogen train, the Coradia iLint, the Prima H4 bi-mode locomotive, and the Aptis electric bus.
